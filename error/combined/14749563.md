The long-term effect of **oxandrolone** on hepatic acute phase proteins in severely burned ~~children~~ . BACKGROUND Acute phase ~~protein~~ production is a hallmark of severe burns . We wondered whether ***anabolic*** **treatment** with ~~oxandrolone~~ would affect these proteins . METHODS Thirty-five ~~children~~ with > or =40 % total body surface area burns were randomized to receive either **placebo** ***or*** **oxandrolone** ( 0.1 mg/kg by mouth twice daily ) from postoperative day 5 to 1 year postburn . Levels of constitutive proteins and acute phase proteins were measured at admission ; at discharge ; and at 6 , 9 , and 12 months after burn . Total albumin supplementation and hepatic transaminases were also assessed . RESULTS Constitutive proteins such as albumin , prealbumin , and retinol-binding protein levels increased ( p < 0.05 ) , and acute phase proteins such as alpha 1-acid glycoprotein , C3 complement , alpha 2-macroglobulin , and fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in the oxandrolone group compared with placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . Albumin supplementation during the acute hospitalization was reduced in the oxandrolone group . Hepatic transaminases remained within normal levels . CONCLUSION Treatment with ~~oxandrolone~~ in severe burns significantly increases constitutive protein and reduces acute phase protein levels .
