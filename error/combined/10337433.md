Comparative evaluation of **olopatadine** ***ophthalmic*** **solution** ( 0.1 % ) versus **ketorolac** ***ophthalmic*** **solution** ( 0.5 % ) using the provocative ~~antigen~~ challenge model . OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of **olopatadine** ***ophthalmic*** **solution** ( 0.1 % ) with **ketorolac** ***ophthalmic*** **solution** ( 0.5 % ) in a clinical model of acute allergic conjunctivitis . **Olopatadine** is a dual acting H1 ~~histamine~~ ~~receptor~~ antagonist and a mast cell stabilizer , shown to be effective in treating allergic conjunctivitis . **Ketorolac** is a ~~non-steroidal~~ anti-inflammatory drug approved in the United ~~States~~ for the ~~relief~~ of ocular itching associated with ~~seasonal~~ allergic conjunctivitis . METHODS The provocative ~~antigen~~ challenge model was used in this randomized , ~~double-blind~~ , single-center , crossover study . The ~~allergen~~ and concentration that consistently elicited a ~~positive~~ allergic reaction was used for challenge . After at least 14 days , subjects were randomized to receive either **olopatadine** in one eye and **placebo** in the contralateral eye , or **ketorolac** in one eye and **placebo** in the contralateral eye . Twenty-seven minutes after drug instillation subjects were challenged with ~~allergen~~ . At 3 , 10 , and 20 minutes following allergen challenge , subjects graded ocular itching and were assessed for hyperemia in conjunctival , ciliary , and episcleral vessel beds . Approximately 14 days later , subjects received the ***alternate*** ***treatment*** in one eye and ***placebo*** in the contralateral eye . They were again challenged with allergen and their responses were rated in the same manner . RESULTS **Olopatadine** significantly ( p < 0.0001 ) reduced both ocular itching and hyperemia in all three vessel beds compared to ***placebo*** at all time points tested following allergen challenge . ***Ketorolac*** did not significantly reduce itching and showed a trend of increased hyperemia compared to ***placebo*** ***.*** **Olopatadine** was significantly ( p < 0.001 ) more effective than ***ketorolac*** in reducing hyperemia and ocular itching at all time points and was also significantly ( p < 0.05 ) more comfortable than ***ketorolac*** as reported by subjects immediately following drug instillation . CONCLUSION The study demonstrated that **olopatadine** is effective and safe in preventing and treating ocular itching and hyperemia associated with acute allergic conjunctivitis and is more effective and more comfortable than ***ketorolac*** ***.***
