Switching patients with asthma from chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) ~~albuterol~~ to ***hydrofluoroalkane-134a*** ***(*** ***HFA*** ***)*** **albuterol** ***.*** Chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) propellants deplete stratospheric ozone . Production and use of CFCs , ~~except~~ for certain critical exemptions , has been prohibited by the Montreal Protocol . Use of CFCs as propellants in ~~metered-dose~~ inhalers ( MDIs ) is still allowed , but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is planning the transition to alternative propellants for use in MDIs . ***Hydrofluoroalkane-134a*** ***(*** ***HFA*** ***)*** , a non-ozone-depleting propellant , has been used to reformulate ~~albuterol~~ ( HFA ~~albuterol~~ ) . This study evaluates whether comparable safety and efficacy continues for 12 weeks after patients with asthma are ***switched*** ***from*** ***CFC*** **albuterol** ***to*** ***HFA*** **albuterol** ***.*** Patients with asthma stabilized on CFC ~~albuterol~~ during a 12-week safety and efficacy trial were randomized to ***either*** ***continue*** ***receiving*** ***CFC*** **albuterol** ***or*** ***to*** ***be*** ***switched*** ***to*** ***receive*** ***HFA*** **albuterol** ***in*** ***a*** ***yearlong*** ***safety*** ***and*** ***efficacy*** ***trial*** ***.*** Safety and efficacy were compared over the first 12 weeks of the yearlong trial between patients who had remained on CFC ~~albuterol~~ and those who had been switched to HFA ~~albuterol~~ . Bronchodilator efficacy was evaluated by serial spirometry for 6 hr after the patients self-administered the study drug in the clinic . Safety was assessed by measuring changes in pulse rate , blood pressure , and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) intervals after dosing with study drug , monitoring adverse events , and performing prestudy and poststudy laboratory testing and physical examinations . No significant differences in bronchodilator efficacy between the patients continuing to receive CFC ~~albuterol~~ and those switched to ***HFA*** **albuterol** were found in the 12 weeks after the switch . No differences between the two products were found for changes in pulse rate , blood pressure , and ECG intervals . Adverse event profiles were similar for the two products , except the patients remaining on CFC ~~albuterol~~ reported increased asthma symptoms and rhinitis significantly more often than the patients switched to HFA ~~albuterol~~ . No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory tests or physical examinations were found in either treatment group . Patients with asthma switched from CFC ~~albuterol~~ to ***HFA*** **albuterol** receive comparable bronchodilation with a similar safety profile as those continuing to receive CFC ~~albuterol~~ .
