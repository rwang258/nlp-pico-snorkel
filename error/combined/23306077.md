Translating the ***Dietary*** ***Approaches*** ***to*** ***Stop*** ***Hypertension*** ***(*** ***DASH*** ***)*** ***diet*** for use in underresourced , urban African American communities , 2010 . INTRODUCTION Randomized trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the ***Dietary*** ***Approaches*** ***to*** ***Stop*** ***Hypertension*** ***(*** ***DASH*** ***)*** program for lowering blood pressure ; however , program participation has been limited in some populations . The objective of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of using a culturally ~~modified~~ version of ***DASH*** among African Americans in an underresourced community . METHODS This randomized ~~controlled~~ pilot study recruited African Americans in 2 North ~~Carolina~~ neighborhoods who had high blood pressure and used fewer than 3 antihypertension medications . We offered 2 ***individual*** ***and*** 9 ***group*** ***DASH*** ***sessions*** to ~~intervention~~ participants and ***1*** ***individual*** ***session*** ***and*** ***printed*** ***DASH*** ***educational*** ***materials*** ***to*** **control** ***participants*** ***.*** We collected data at baseline ( March 2010 ) and 12 weeks ( June 2010 ) . RESULTS Of 152 potential participants , 25 were randomly assigned to either the ***intervention*** ( n = 14 ) or the **control** ( n = 11 ) group ; 22 were women , and 21 were educated beyond high school . At baseline , mean blood pressure was 130/78 mm Hg ; 19 participants used antihypertension medications , and mean body mass index was 35.9 kg/m ( 2 ) . Intervention participants attended 7 of 9 group sessions on average . After 12 weeks , we observed significant increases in fruit and vegetable consumption and increases in participants ' confidence in their ability to reduce salt and fat consumption and eat healthier snacks in intervention compared with ~~control~~ participants . We found no significant decreases in blood pressure . CONCLUSION Implementation of a culturally modified , ***community-based*** ***DASH*** ***intervention*** was feasible in our small sample of African Americans , which included people being treated for high blood pressure . Future studies should evaluate the long-term effect of this program in a larger sample .
