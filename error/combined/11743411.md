Capsular contracture around ***saline-filled*** ***fine*** ***textured*** ***and*** **smooth** ***mammary*** ***implants*** ***:*** a prospective 7.5-year follow-up . In a previous prospective randomized clinical study ~~comparing~~ in the same patient textured and ~~smooth~~ ***saline-filled*** ***mammary*** ***implants*** ***(*** ***Biocell*** ***)*** with large pore size ( 300 to 600 microm ) , we saw no difference in capsular contracture . This study was undertaken in a similar way to compare capsular contracture around ~~smooth~~ and textured ***saline-filled*** **prostheses** with pores of small size . During a period of 7.5 years , the breast hardness was followed up , and at the end of the study patient satisfaction was evaluated . Twenty healthy women with a mean age of 30 years were operated on for breast augmentation . Two surgeons performed all operations in a ~~standardized~~ way . Each patient received ***subglandularly*** ***a*** ***Siltex*** ***textured*** ***saline-filled*** **prosthesis** with a pore size of 30 to 70 microm in one breast , and a **smooth** ***saline-filled*** **prosthesis** ***in*** ***the*** ***other*** ***.*** The hardness of the breasts was evaluated after 0.5 , 1 , and 7.5 years using Baker grading and applanation tonometry . Eighteen patients completed 1-year and 7.5-year follow-up . Two breasts with ~~smooth~~ ~~prostheses~~ were contracted after 6 months ( Baker III or IV ) . After 1 year , four patients with smooth prostheses and one with a textured prosthesis had capsular contracture ( p = 0.34 ) . Seven and one-half years after surgery , six patents with smooth and four with textured ***implants*** had contracture ( p = 0.66 ) . On two patients with smooth prostheses and one patient with a textured prosthesis , the capsule around the implant hardened between 6 and 12 months . Between 1 year and 7.5 years , three breasts with smooth and textured implants contracted and one with a textured implant softened.The patients reported on a Visual Analogue Scale ( 1 to 10 ) the impact of the augmentation on their quality of life to be 9 +/- 1 . Four patients preferred the breast with the smooth prosthesis , three preferred the breast with the textured prosthesis , and the others found both breasts equal . This study showed no significant difference of contracture with smooth versus fine textured implants . The majority of the patients preferred the smooth implants . The patients reported that the breast augmentation had had an extremely high impact on their quality of life .
