**Lithium** and granulocytopenia during induction ~~therapy~~ of acute myelogenous leukemia . Twenty-seven patients receiving a **standard** **cytosine** ***arabinoside*** ***and*** **daunorubicin** ***regimen*** as induction of reinduction ~~therapy~~ of acute myelogenous leukemia were randomly assigned to receive **lithium** **carbonate** ***,*** ***300*** ***mg*** ***t.i.d.*** , ***or*** ***no*** **lithium** ***.*** Treatment ~~groups~~ were comparable with respect to age and baseline granulocyte counts . All patients developed granulocyte nadirs below 100/cu mm . By actuarial analysis , the median duration of granulocytopenia , less than 1000/cu mm , was 16.0 days in the ***lithium*** group and 24.6 days in the ***no-lithium*** group , p = 0.013 . The median duration of granulocytes less than 500/cu mm also favored the ***lithium*** group but only approached statistical significance : 14.0 days versus 20.5 days , p = 0.054 . ***Lithium*** levels between 0.5 and 1.0 meq/liter were easily maintained in 11 of 12 patients receiving ***lithium*** , 300 mg t.i.d. , and toxicity directly attributable to ***lithium*** was not observed . Despite the shortened duration of neutropenia , the incidence of infections and the rate of remission were not affected .
