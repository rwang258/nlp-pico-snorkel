The relationship between histology and outcome in advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer patients participating in first-line **chemotherapy** trials : a Gynecologic Oncology Group study . OBJECTIVES To explore associations between histology and outcome in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer patients participating in Gynecologic Oncology Group ~~chemotherapy~~ trials . METHODS Age , race , performance ~~status~~ , histologic type ( serous=S ; clear cell=CC ; endometrioid=E ) , disease stage , and prior radiation were evaluated using ***various*** ***analytic*** ***methods*** ***to*** ***evaluate*** ***the*** ***probability*** ***of*** ***response*** ***and*** ***identify*** ***independent*** **predictors** ***of*** ***progression-free*** ***survival*** ***(*** ***PFS*** ***)*** ***and*** ***overall*** ***survival*** ***(*** ***OS*** ***)*** ***.*** RESULTS **Single** ***agent*** or **combination** **chemotherapy** ***regimens*** including **doxorubicin** ***(*** ***A*** ***)*** ( 12 % ) , **doxorubicin/cisplatin** ( AP ) ( 63 % ) , **doxorubicin/paclitaxel** ( AT ) ( 13 % ) , and **paclitaxel/doxorubicin/cisplatin** ( TAP ) ( 11 % ) were used among 1203 patients ~~treated~~ on 4 randomized clinical trials . Breakdown of disease stage was 7.8 % stage III , 22.8 % stage IV , and 69.4 % recurrent disease . Histologic distribution was 18 % S , 3.7 % CC , 8.5 % mixed , 51.7 % E and 18.1 % other . More S/CC patients enrolled on trials with advanced stage ( III-IV ) disease ( as opposed to recurrent disease ) compared to E patients ( 45 % vs. 24 % , p < 0.05 ) . Overall response rate was 42 % ( E=44 % , S=44 % , CC=32 % ) . Histologic type was not an independent predictor of response . Independent predictors of PFS included race , performance status , disease stage , and CC histology . Histology was also an independent predictor of OS ; the relative hazard ratio for S histology was 1.2 ( 1.02-1.4 ; p=0.03 ) , and for CC was 1.51 ( 1.1-2.07 ; p=0.01 ) . CONCLUSION In patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer treated with A , P and/or T , response was not associated with histology . This exploratory analysis does not support exclusion of S tumors in future trials . Poorer PFS and OS were observed in CC compared to other types , but a lack of benefit from chemotherapy was not shown , and as this histology represents such a small fraction , it does not seem feasible to have separate chemotherapy trials for CC .
