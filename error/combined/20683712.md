***Sunlight*** **exposure** ***or*** **vitamin** ***D*** ***supplementation*** for ~~vitamin~~ D-deficient ~~non-western~~ immigrants : a randomized clinical trial . UNLABELLED **Vitamin** ***D*** deficiency is very common in ~~non-western~~ immigrants . In this randomized clinical trial , **vitamin** ***D*** 800 IU/day or 100,000 IU/3 months were compared with ***advised*** ***sunlight*** **exposure** ***.*** **Vitamin** ***D*** ***supplementation*** was more effective than ***advised*** ***sunlight*** **exposure** in improving ~~vitamin~~ D ~~status~~ and lowering ~~parathyroid~~ ~~hormone~~ levels . INTRODUCTION ~~Vitamin~~ D deficiency ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] < 25 nmol/l ) is common among ~~non-western~~ immigrants . It can be ~~treated~~ ***with*** **vitamin** ***D*** ***supplementation*** ***or*** ***sunlight*** **exposure** . METHODS To ~~determine~~ whether the ***effect*** ***of*** **vitamin** ***D*** ***(*** ***3*** ***)*** ***supplementation*** ***(*** ***daily*** ***800*** ***IU*** ***or*** ***100,000*** ***IU/3*** ***months*** ***)*** ***or*** ***sunlight*** **exposure** ***advice*** is similar with regard to serum 25 ( OH ) D and ~~parathyroid~~ ~~hormone~~ ( PTH ) concentrations . Randomized clinical trial in 11 general practices in The Netherlands . ~~Non-western~~ immigrants , aged 18-65 years ( n = 232 ) and serum 25 ( OH ) D < 25 nmol/l were randomly ***assigned*** ***to*** ***supplementation*** ( daily 800 IU or 100,000 ***IU/3*** ***months*** ***)*** ***or*** ***advice*** ***for*** ***sunlight*** exposure for 6 months ( March-September ) . Blood samples were collected at baseline , during treatment ( 3 months , 6 months ) , and at follow-up ( 12 months ) . Statistical analysis was performed with multilevel regression modelling . RESULTS The intention-to-treat analysis included 211 persons . Baseline serum 25 ( OH ) D was 22.5 Â± 11.1 nmol/l . After 6 months , mean serum 25 ( OH ) D increased to 53 nmol/l with 800 IU/day , to 50.5 nmol/l with 100,000 IU/3 months , and to ***29.1*** ***nmol/l*** ***with*** ***advised*** ***sunlight*** ***exposure*** ***(*** ***supplementation*** vs sunshine p < 0.001 ) . Serum PTH decreased significantly in all groups after ***3*** ***months*** ***,*** ***more*** ***in*** the ***supplementation*** ***groups*** ***than*** ***in*** the advised sunlight group ( p < 0.05 ) . There was no significant effect on physical performance and ***functional*** ***limitations*** ***.*** ***CONCLUSION*** ***Vitamin*** D ***supplementation*** ***is*** ***more*** ***effective*** ***than*** ***advised*** sunlight exposure for treating vitamin D deficiency in non-western immigrants .
