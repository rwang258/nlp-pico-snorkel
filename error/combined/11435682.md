Patient positioning influences ~~oxygen~~ saturation in the acute phase of stroke . We evaluated ~~arterial~~ ~~oxygen~~ saturation ( SaO ( 2 ) ) and heart rate in acute stroke patients to ~~determine~~ whether routine positioning affected these physiological parameters . Measurements were recorded at the bedside non-invasively in ***five*** ***different*** ***positions*** assigned in random order each maintained for 10 min . One hundred and twenty-nine patients examined within a ***median*** of 72 h , ***lying*** ***on*** ***the*** ***left*** ***side*** resulted in slightly lower SaO ( 2 ) than ***lying*** ***on*** ***the*** ***right*** ***side*** , which was ~~statistically~~ significant in the patients with a right ( n = 66 ) , but not left , hemiparesis . Patients able to ***sit*** ***in*** ***a*** ***chair*** ( n = 65 ) , who mostly had less severe strokes , had a significantly higher mean SaO ( 2 ) and heart rate when sitting in the chair than when placed in any other position . About 10 % of patients , especially those with a severe stroke , with right hemiparesis and concomitant chest disease , experienced falls in SaO ( 2 ) to 90 % or less for > /=2 min in certain positions ; the hypoxia was more likely when they were ***lying*** ***on*** ***their*** ***left*** ***side*** ***.*** These results may have implications for current practice and for future patient positioning strategies to improve outcome after stroke .
