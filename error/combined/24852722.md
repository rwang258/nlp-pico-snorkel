Causes of variation in ***BCG*** **vaccine** efficacy : examining evidence from the BCG REVAC ~~cluster~~ randomized trial to explore the masking and the blocking hypotheses . BCG protection varies and in some places ( nearest the equator ) is low or absent . Understanding this variation can inform the efforts to develop new ~~vaccines~~ against tuberculosis . Two main hypotheses are used to explain this variation : under masking , new ~~vaccines~~ are unlikely to increase protection ; under blocking new ~~vaccines~~ have a greater potential to be effective when BCG is not . We conducted a ~~cluster~~ randomized trial to explored the masking and blocking hypotheses by studying ***BCG*** **vaccine** efficacy of ~~neonatal~~ ~~vaccination~~ and when ~~administered~~ for the first or a second ( ~~revaccination~~ ) time at school age in two sites ( Manaus close and Salvador further south from the equator ) . Seven hundred and sixty three ~~state~~ schools were matched on socio economic characteristics of the neighborhood and 239,934 ~~children~~ were randomized to ~~vaccine~~ ***(*** ***BCG*** **vaccination** at school age ) or ***control*** ***group*** ***.*** Protection by first ***BCG*** ***vaccination*** at school age was high in Salvador ( 34 % , 95 % CI 7-53 % , p=0.017 ) but low in Manaus ( 8 % , 95 % CI t0 39-40 % , p=0.686 ) . For revaccination at school age , protection was modest in Salvador ( 19 % , 95 % CI 3-33 % , p=0.022 ) and absent in Manaus ( 1 % , 95 % CI to 27-23 % , p=0.932 ) . ~~Vaccine~~ efficacy for neonatal vaccination was similar in Salvador ( 40 % , 95 % CI 22-54 % , p < 0.001 ) and Manaus ( 36 % , 95 % CI 11-53 % , p=0.008 ) . Variation in ***BCG*** efficacy was marked when ~~vaccine~~ was given at school age but absent at birth , which points towards blocking as the dominant mechanism . New tuberculosis vaccines that overcome or by pass this blocking effect could confer protection in situations where BCG is not protective .
