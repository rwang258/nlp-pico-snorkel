**Atomoxetine** alone or ~~combined~~ with **fluoxetine** for treating ADHD with comorbid depressive or anxiety symptoms . OBJECTIVE Symptoms of depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . The authors assessed the safety and effectiveness of **atomoxetine** ~~monotherapy~~ compared with ~~combined~~ **atomoxetine/fluoxetine** **therapy** in a population of ~~children~~ and ~~adolescents~~ with ADHD and concurrent symptoms of depression or anxiety . ~~METHOD~~ Patients were randomized to ~~treatment~~ with **fluoxetine** ***(*** ***n*** ***=*** ***127*** ***)*** ***or*** **placebo** ( n = 46 ) under ~~double-blind~~ conditions for 8 weeks , with **concomitant** **atomoxetine** ***use*** ***the*** ***last*** ***5*** ***weeks*** ***.*** RESULTS At end point , reductions in ADHD , depressive , and anxiety symptoms were marked for both treatment ~~groups~~ ( p < .001 for the relevant scale in each symptom cluster ) . Some differences between treatment groups for depressive symptoms were significant , but the magnitudes of the differences were small and likely of limited clinical importance . Completion rates for the two groups were similar , as were discontinuation rates for adverse events . The combination group had greater increases in blood pressure and pulse than did the monotherapy group . CONCLUSIONS In pediatric patients with ADHD and comorbid symptoms of depression or anxiety , **atomoxetine** ***monotherapy*** appears to be effective for treating ADHD . Anxiety and depressive symptoms also improved , but the absence of a placebo-only arm does not allow us to conclude that these effects are specifically the result of treatment with **atomoxetine** ***.*** ***Combined*** ***atomoxetine/fluoxetine*** therapy was well tolerated .
