Safety and efficacy of a low molecular weight ~~heparin~~ ( ~~Logiparin~~ ) versus ~~dextran~~ as prophylaxis against thrombosis after total hip replacement . In order to study the ~~plasma~~ levels of ~~factor~~ XaI and IIaI activity an ***enzymatically*** ***depolymerized*** ***low*** ***molecular*** ***weight*** **heparin** ***(*** **LMW-heparin** ***;*** **Logiparin** ***)*** was given s.c. in a ~~dose~~ of 35 XaI mu/kg b.w . once daily for 7 days to 10 patients undergoing total hip replacement ( THR ) in a pilot study . The XaI activity was less than or equal to 0.24 XaI units/ml and the IIaI activity less than or equal to 0.043 IIaI mu/ml . No accumulation of the activities were seen . No phlebographically verified ~~thrombi~~ or any bleeding complications were ~~registered~~ . From this study it was concluded that the given ~~dose~~ of ~~Logiparin~~ was safe with regard to bleeding complications . Based on these data , an open , randomized controlled trial was started . In this main study the thromboprophylactic effect of the LMW-heparin ( Logiparin ) in a dose of 35 XaI mu/kg b.w . once daily was compared with that of dextran 70 in patients undergoing THR . 100 patients were randomized . The over-all thrombosis rate was 28 % in patients treated with LMW-heparin and 39 % in those given dextran , a non-significant difference . No bleeding complications , deaths or pulmonary embolism were recorded in either group . Peroperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were similar in the two groups . In conclusion , the investigated LMW-heparin ( Logiparin ) is safe and effective in preventing postoperative thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip replacement , but the dosage can probably be optimized .
