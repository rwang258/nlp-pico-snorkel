Time to onset of clinically meaningful improvement with **tadalafil** 5 mg once daily for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign ~~prostatic~~ hyperplasia : analysis of data ~~pooled~~ from 4 pivotal , ~~double-blind~~ , **placebo** ~~controlled~~ studies . PURPOSE **Tadalafil** once daily for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign ~~prostatic~~ hyperplasia consistently shows ~~statistically~~ significant I-PSS improvements . However , physicians and patients wish to know whether **tadalafil** provides rapid , clinically meaningful improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms . In this post hoc analysis we ~~integrated~~ results from 4 **placebo** ~~controlled~~ studies to ~~determine~~ the duration of **tadalafil** once daily required to achieve clinically meaningful improvement . MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed post hoc analysis of data ~~integrated~~ from 4 ~~double-blind~~ studies of **tadalafil** 5 mg ***and*** **placebo** once daily in 742 and 735 men , respectively , 45 years old or older with total I-PSS 13 or greater . Two clinically meaningful improvement categories were assessed , including 1 ) 3-point or greater baseline to end point total I-PSS improvement and 2 ) 25 % or greater baseline to end point total I-PSS improvement . I-PSS was assessed at weeks 4 , 8 and 12 in all studies , week 1 in 2 and week 2 in 1 . Results in men treated with **tadalafil** who showed clinically meaningful improvement ( responders ) were further examined to determine the earliest time to clinically meaningful improvement . RESULTS Of 742 **tadalafil** treated patients 513 ( 69.1 % ) and 444 ( 59.8 % ) demonstrated category 1 and 2 clinically meaningful improvement , respectively , at the study end point . Of 234 category 1 responders with week 1 assessments 140 ( 59.8 % ) achieved clinically meaningful improvement by week 1 and 407 of the total of 513 category 1 responders ( 79.3 % ) showed it by week 4 . Of the 205 category 2 responders with week 1 assessments 103 ( 50.2 % ) achieved clinically meaningful improvement by week 1 while 322 of the 444 category 2 responders ( 72.5 % ) did so by week 4 . CONCLUSIONS **Tadalafil** 5 mg once daily led to clinically meaningful improvement in approximately two-thirds of men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia . More than half of this group of **tadalafil** treated responders achieved clinically meaningful improvement after 1 week of therapy and more than 70 % did so within 4 weeks .
