Effect of oral ***diuretics*** on pulmonary mechanics in ~~infants~~ with chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia : results of a ~~double-blind~~ crossover sequential trial . In a randomized ~~double-blind~~ crossover trial with sequential analysis , the effects of oral ***diuretics*** were compared with the effects of **placebo** on pulmonary mechanics in ten ~~infants~~ with bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . Pulmonary mechanics were measured before and at the end of a week of ~~treatment~~ with ***oral*** ***diuretics*** ***(*** **chlorothiazide** ***,*** ***20*** **mg/kg/dose** ***and*** **spironolactone** ***,*** ***1.5*** **mg/kg/dose** ***)*** ***given*** ***twice*** ***daily*** ***,*** ***or*** **placebo** ***.*** Mean airway resistance decreased 35.3 cm H2O/L/s , mean specific airway conductance increased 0.095 1/L/s/cm H2O , and mean dynamic pulmonary ~~compliance~~ increased 1.74 mL/cm H2O during ~~treatment~~ with diuretics ( all P less than .001 ) , but not during treatment with placebo . The infants ' rate of weight gain decreased on the first three days of diuretic treatment , but was thereafter comparable with weight gain during treatment with ***placebo*** ***.*** Fluid intake was similar in infants receiving diuretics and ***placebo*** ***.*** But , infants receiving diuretics not only had significantly increased urine output , osmolal clearance , and potassium and phosphorus excretion , but these infants also retained less fluid , and , in addition , excreted less ~~calcium~~ than infants receiving placebo . It is concluded that oral ***diuretics*** improve lung function in infants with chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia ; however , potassium and phosphorus depletion are potential complications of treatment .
