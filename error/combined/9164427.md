Clinical effects of **buspirone** in social phobia : a ~~double-blind~~ ~~placebo-controlled~~ study . BACKGROUND The results of open pilot studies ~~suggest~~ that the ***serotonin-1A*** ***(*** ***5-HT1A*** ***)*** **receptor** ***agonist*** **buspirone** might be effective in social phobia . ~~METHOD~~ In the present study , the efficacy of **buspirone** was investigated in patients with social phobia using a 12-week ~~double-blind~~ **placebo-controlled** design . Thirty social phobic patients ( DSM-IV ) were ~~treated~~ with either **buspirone** ***30*** ***mg*** ***daily*** ***or*** **placebo** ***.*** Efficacy of ~~treatment~~ was measured using the Social Phobia Scale ( subscores anxiety and avoidance ) and the Hamilton ~~Rating~~ Scale for Anxiety . RESULTS Taking a ~~reduction~~ of 50 % or more on the Social Phobia Scale as a criterion for clinically relevant improvement , only 1 patient on ~~buspirone~~ and 1 on placebo were classified as responder to treatment . A subjective and clinically relevant improvement was reported by 4 patients ( 27 % ) on ~~buspirone~~ and 2 patients ( 13 % ) on ***placebo*** ***.*** There were no statistically significant differences between **buspirone** ***and*** ***placebo*** on any of the outcome measures . Generally speaking , ~~buspirone~~ was well tolerated . CONCLUSION The results of the study do not support the results of open studies , in which a reduction of social anxiety and social avoidance was reported in patients with social phobia treated with **buspirone** ***.***
