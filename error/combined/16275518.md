The evaluation of pulmonary hypertension using ***right*** ***ventricular*** ***myocardial*** ***isovolumic*** ***relaxation*** ***time*** ***.*** Right ventricular ( RV ) blood pool-derived isovolumic relaxation time ( IVRT ) correlates well with systolic pulmonary ~~arterial~~ pressure ( PAP ) . However , because of ~~complex~~ parameter derivation , the ~~method~~ is rarely used . The aim of this study was to validate the measurement of myocardial velocity imaging-derived ***RV*** ***IVRT*** ***(*** ***IVRT*** ***'*** ***)*** against ***invasively*** ***measured*** ***PAP*** ***.*** ***Transthoracic*** ***echocardiography*** ***with*** ***myocardial*** ***velocity*** ***imaging*** ***and*** ***right*** ***heart*** ***catheterization*** were performed in 33 patients with pulmonary hypertension . Blood pool IVRT and myocardial IVRTs for the tricuspid valve annulus ring , basal and apical RV free wall segments were measured and compared with data from 33 age- and sex-matched ~~control~~ subjects . Measured IVRTs were significantly longer in patients with pulmonary hypertension than in ~~control~~ subjects . The strongest correlation ( R = 0.74 , P < .0001 ) was found between systolic PAP and the heart rate-corrected IVRT ' derived from the basal RV free wall segment . The basal segment IVRT ' corrected for heart rate correlates well with the invasive PAP measurement and , therefore , can be used to predict systolic PAP . It can even be considered as an alternative to tricuspid regurgitation-derived PAP systolic when tricuspid regurgitation is nonrecordable . A proposed method to derive systolic PAP should be used while screening the patients at risk for pulmonary hypertension , monitoring the disease progression and the effect of treatment .
