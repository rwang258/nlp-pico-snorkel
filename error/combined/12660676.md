Sustained ventricular arrhythmias and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction : results from the GUSTO-III trial . BACKGROUND In many patients , ventricular arrhythmias will develop early after acute myocardial infarction . We studied the incidence , timing , and outcomes of such arrhythmias in the international Global Utilization of Streptokinase and TPA ( ~~alteplase~~ ) for Occluded Coronary ~~Arteries~~ ( GUSTO ) -III trial . METHODS ***We*** ***identified*** ***independent*** **predictors** ***of*** ***inhospital*** ***ventricular*** ***fibrillation*** ***(*** ***VF*** ***)*** ***and*** ***ventricular*** ***tachycardia*** ***(*** ***VT*** ***)*** ***and*** ***compared*** ***30-day*** ***and*** ***1-year*** ***mortality*** ***rates*** ***of*** ***patients*** ***who*** ***did*** ***(*** ***n*** ***=*** ***1121*** ***)*** ***and*** ***did*** ***not*** ***(*** ***n*** ***=*** ***13,921*** ***)*** ***have*** ***these*** ***arrhythmias*** ***during*** ***the*** ***index*** ***hospitalization*** ***.*** RESULTS Significant independent ~~predictors~~ of inhospital VF were higher Killip class , lower baseline systolic pressure , ~~intravenous~~ preenrollment **lidocaine** ***use*** , shorter time to thrombolysis , and ***beta-blocker*** ***use*** < 2 weeks before enrollment ; independent ~~predictors~~ of inhospital VT were lower baseline systolic pressure , intravenous ~~lidocaine~~ use before enrollment , higher Killip class , faster baseline heart rate , and advanced age . The 30-day mortality rate was 31 % in patients with VF , 24 % in those with VT , 44 % in those with both , and 6 % in those with neither ( P =.001 ) . The corresponding 1-year mortality rates were 34 % , 29 % , 49 % , and 9 % ( P =.001 ) . The 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were higher for patients with late ( > 48 hours after enrollment ) versus early arrhythmias ( < or =48 hours after enrollment ) . CONCLUSIONS Despite thrombolysis , inhospital ventricular arrhythmias are associated with higher 30-day and 1-year mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction , particularly when occurring later during the initial hospitalization . Better therapies are needed to improve outcomes of these arrhythmias .
