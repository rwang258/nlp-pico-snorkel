Peak expiratory flow rate was compared pre- and postoperatively in the two groups . Use of nerve stimulation did not significantly alter the requirements for analgesia although there was a reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting in the nerve stimulation group . There was no difference between the two groups with respect to changes in peak expiratory flow rate .
