Outcomes and biochemical parameters following ***cardiac*** **surgery** ***:*** effects of ***transfusion*** ***of*** ***residual*** ***blood*** using ***centrifugation*** ***and*** ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** ***.*** OBJECTIVES To ~~determine~~ whether or not there was a significant difference between the ***methods*** ***of*** ***centrifugation*** ***(*** ***CF*** ***)*** ***and*** ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** ***(*** ***MPH*** ***)*** of the residual cardiopulmonary-bypass volume in relation to biochemical measurements and patient outcomes . DESIGN Prospective , randomized , and ~~controlled~~ . SETTING Conducted at a ~~western~~ Canadian tertiary care hospital . PARTICIPANTS Consisted of 61 consecutive male and female patients from ages 40 to 80 who were scheduled for ***cardiac*** **surgery** with ***cardiopulmonary*** ***bypass*** ***.*** ~~INTERVENTIONS~~ Either the ***centrifugation*** ***or*** ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** **method** was used to process the residual blood from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit . RESULTS The 12-hour postoperative levels of serum hemoglobin were not significantly different in the ***centrifugation*** group as compared to the ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** group . However , the serum levels of total protein and albumin were significantly higher in the ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** group as compared to the ***centrifugation*** group . Additionally , after 12-hours postoperatively , the serum fibrinogen and platelet counts were significantly higher in the ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** group as compared to those of the ***centrifugation*** group . The allogeneic product transfusion index and the chest-tube blood drainage indices were lower in the ***multiple-pass*** ***hemoconcentration*** group as compared to the ***centrifugation*** group . CONCLUSION Although the ***CF*** ***method*** provided a product in a shorter turnaround time , with consistent clearance of **heparin** , the ***MPH*** ***method*** trended towards enhanced biochemical and clinical patient outcomes over the 12-hour postoperative period .
