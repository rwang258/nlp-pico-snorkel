Are **tyrosine** **kinase** ***inhibitors*** still ~~active~~ in patients with ~~metastatic~~ renal cell carcinoma previously ~~treated~~ with a **tyrosine** **kinase** **inhibitor** and **everolimus** ? Experience of 36 patients ~~treated~~ in France in the RECORD-1 Trial . BACKGROUND Because the response to ~~treatment~~ is limited , patients with ~~metastatic~~ renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) typically receive multiple ~~treatments~~ . Guidelines recommend **everolimus** for patients previously ~~treated~~ with **tyrosine** **kinase** ***inhibitors*** ***(*** ***TKI*** ***)*** **sunitinib** ***or*** **sorafenib** ***.*** This study evaluated the efficacy of ***TKI*** ~~re-treatment~~ in patients with disease progression after a **TKI-everolimus** **sequence** ***.*** PATIENTS AND METHODS Data were reviewed for patients enrolled in RECORD-1 ( Renal Cell Cancer ~~Treatment~~ With Oral RAD001 Given Daily ) at French sites . Response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , and overall survival were evaluated in patients ~~treated~~ with a **TKI-everolimus-TKI** **sequence** ***.*** RESULTS Thirty-six patients received a ***TKI*** after **everolimus** ***:*** **sunitinib** in 17 patients , ***sorafenib*** in 15 , and ***dovitinib*** ( TKI258 ) in 4 . The response rate with ***TKI*** re-treatment was 8 % , and the disease-control rate ( response plus stable disease ) was 75 % . The median PFS with each component of the ***TKI-everolimus-TKI*** sequence was 10.7 months ( 95 % CI , 1.8-28.5 months ) , 8.9 months ( 95 % CI , 1.7-34.6 months ) , and 8.2 months ( 95 % CI , 5.2-11.9 months ) , respectively . The median overall survival from the start of **everolimus** was 29.1 months ( 95 % CI 21.1 to not reached months ) , which suggests a benefit in using ***TKI*** in this setting . CONCLUSIONS Administration of a ***TKI-everolimus-TKI*** ***sequence*** may be associated with clinical benefit and should be prospectively investigated .
