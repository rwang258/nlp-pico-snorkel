The effect of lowering LDL ~~cholesterol~~ on vascular access patency : post hoc analysis of the Study of Heart and Renal Protection . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Reducing LDL ~~cholesterol~~ ( LDL-C ) with **statin-based** **therapy** reduces the risk of major atherosclerotic events among patients with CKD , including dialysis patients , but the effect of lowering LDL-C on vascular access patency is unclear . DESIGN , SETTING , PARTICIPANTS , & MEASUREMENTS The Study of Heart and Renal Protection ( SHARP ) randomized patients with CKD to ***20*** ***mg*** **simvastatin** ***plus*** ***10*** ***mg*** **ezetimibe** ***daily*** ***versus*** ***matching*** **placebo** ***.*** This study aimed to explore the effects of ~~treatment~~ on vascular access occlusive events , defined as any access revision procedure , access thrombosis , removal of an old dialysis access , or formation of new permanent dialysis access . RESULTS Among 2353 SHARP participants who had functioning vascular access at randomization , allocation to ~~simvastatin~~ plus ~~ezetimibe~~ resulted in a 13 % proportional ~~reduction~~ in vascular access occlusive events ( 355 [ 29.7 % ] for **simvastatin/ezetimibe** versus 388 [ 33.5 % ] for **placebo** ***;*** risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.87 ; 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] , 0.75 to 1.00 ; P=0.05 ) . There was no evidence that the effects of treatment differed for any of the separate components of this outcome . To test the hypothesis raised by SHARP , comparable analyses were performed using the AURORA ( A Study to Evaluate the Use of ~~Rosuvastatin~~ in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis : An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events ) trial cohort . AURORA did not provide independent confirmation ( vascular access occlusive events : 352 [ 28.9 % ] for ~~rosuvastatin~~ versus 337 [ 27.6 % ] for placebo ; RR , 1.06 , 95 % CI , 0.91 to 1.23 ; P=0.44 ) . After combining the two trials , the overall effect of reducing LDL-C with a statin-based regimen on vascular access occlusive events was not statistically significant ( 707 [ 29.3 % ] with any LDL-C-lowering therapy versus 725 [ 30.5 % ] with placebo ; RR , 0.95 , 95 % CI , 0.85 to 1.05 ; P=0.29 ) . CONCLUSIONS Exploratory analyses from SHARP suggest that lowering LDL-C with ***statin-based*** ***therapy*** may improve vascular access patency , but there was no evidence of benefit in AURORA . Taken together , the available evidence suggests that any benefits of lowering LDL-C on vascular access patency are likely to be modest .
