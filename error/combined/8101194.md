Comparison of the effects of **terazosin** and **enalapril** on laboratory stress testing blood pressure in patients with ~~essential~~ hypertension . It is the current opinion that an ideal ***antihypertensive*** ***drug*** should ~~reduce~~ blood pressure ( BP ) not only at rest but also during stressful situations . The current study was aimed to compare the effects of the ***selective*** ***alpha*** ***1-adrenergic*** ***blocker*** **terazosin** ( 5 mg once daily ) and of the ***angiotensin-converting*** ***enzyme*** **inhibitor** **enalapril** ( 20 mg once daily ) on cardiovascular response to a set of ~~standardized~~ laboratory stressors , such as mental ~~arithmetic~~ , handgrip test and cycle ergometry , in a group of 16 ~~essential~~ hypertensive patients . The study was a randomized , ~~double-blind~~ , cross-over trial preceded by a **placebo** run-in period . **Terazosin** ***and*** **enalapril** had a comparable effect on resting BP , reducing systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic ( DBP ) blood pressure from 159.5 +/- 13.9/101.6 +/- 8.8 mm Hg during ~~placebo~~ by 7.8 % /6.7 % and by 11.3 % /10.2 % , respectively . The " response " rate to the two treatments was approximately the same , being 69 % and 75 % after **terazosin** and **enalapril** , respectively . During mental arithmetic , from an average of 181.6 +/- 17.8/118.6 +/- 11.5 mm Hg during ***placebo*** , BP was reduced by 11.5 % /7.9 % after **terazosin** and by 13.6 % /8.5 % after **enalapril** ***;*** during handgrip test , BP decreased from 207.2 +/- 22.2/142.2 +/- 13.6 mm Hg by 7.3 % /8.4 % after **terazosin** and by 7.7 % /7.1 % after **enalapril** ***;*** finally , during cycle ergometry , ~~terazosin~~ and ~~enalapril~~ lowered BP by 5.4 % /6.7 % and 7 % /3.1 % , respectively , from a ***placebo*** value of 215.5 +/- 17.3/127.6 +/- 11.2 . No significant difference in antihypertensive efficacy was observed between the two drugs , either at rest and during stress testing . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
