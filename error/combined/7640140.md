Comparison of ***non-invasive*** ***methods*** for the assessment of ***haemodynamic*** drug effects in healthy male and female volunteers : sex differences in cardiovascular responsiveness . 1 . The study was performed to ~~determine~~ the ~~sensitivity~~ and short-term and day-to-day variability of a novel technique based on ***laser*** ***interferometry*** ***of*** ***ocular*** **fundus** ***pulsations*** ***and*** ***of*** ***non-invasive*** ***methods*** for the quantification of haemodynamic drug effects . An additional aim was to assess sex differences in haemodynamic responsiveness to cardiovascular drugs in male and female healthy volunteers . 2 . Ten males and nine females ( age range 20-33 years ) were studied in a ~~double-blind~~ , randomized , cross-over trial . Simultaneous measurements from systemic ***haemodynamics*** ***,*** ***laser*** ***interferometry*** ***of*** ***ocular*** **fundus** ***pulsations*** , systolic time intervals from ***mechanocardiography*** , a/b ratio from ***oxymetric*** ***fingerplethysmography*** and ***Doppler*** ***sonography*** of the radial ~~artery~~ were used to describe the haemodynamic effects of cumulative , stepwise increasing **intravenous** **doses** ***of*** **phenylephrine** ***,*** ***isoprenaline*** ***,*** **sodium** **nitroprusside** ***and*** ***of*** **placebo** ***.*** 3 . Laser interferometry detected the isoprenaline-effects at the lowest ~~dose~~ level of 0.1 micrograms min-1 with a high signal-to-noise ratio . The reproducibility of measurements under baseline was high , no changes were observed after systemically effective doses of phenylephrine or sodium ~~nitroprusside~~ . Systolic time intervals were sensitive and specific for isoprenaline-induced effects , PEP and QS2c-measurements had high reproducibility . Fingerplethysmography proved a sensitive measurement for the detection of the vasodilating effects of sodium ~~nitroprusside~~ , but was not specific , and showed low reproducibility . Measurements from Doppler sonography had lower reproducibility and sensitivity compared with the other applied methods . 4 . There was a significant sex difference for several of the haemodynamic parameters under baseline conditions ; however , the responsiveness to the drugs under study was not different , when drug effects were expressed as % -change from the baseline . 5 . ***Laser*** ***interferometry*** is a valuable non-invasive , highly sensitive and specific approach for the detection of pulse pressure changes . A battery of non-invasive tests appears useful for the characterization of cardiovascular drugs . Gender differences may not pose a relevant problem for the study of acute haemodynamic effects of cardiovascular drugs .
