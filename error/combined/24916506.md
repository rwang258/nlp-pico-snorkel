PTK2 expression and ~~immunochemotherapy~~ outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Addition of **rituximab** ***(*** ***R*** ***)*** ***to*** **fludarabine** ***and*** **cyclophosphamide** ( FC ) has significantly improved patient outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Whether baseline gene expression can identify patients who will benefit from ~~immunochemotherapy~~ over ~~chemotherapy~~ alone has not been ~~determined~~ . We assessed genome-wide expression of 300 ~~pretreatment~~ specimens from a subset of 552 patients in REACH , a study of ***FC*** or ***R-FC*** in relapsed CLL . An independent test set was ~~derived~~ from 282 ~~pretreatment~~ specimens from CLL8 , a study of FC or R-FC in ~~treatment-na√Øve~~ patients . Genes specific for benefit ***from*** ***R-FC*** were ~~determined~~ by assessing ~~treatment-gene~~ interactions in Cox proportional hazards models . REACH patients with higher pretreatment protein tyrosine kinase 2 ( PTK2 ) messenger RNA levels derived greater benefit ***from*** ***R-FC*** , with significant improvements in progression-free survival , independent of known prognostic factors in a multivariate model . Examination of PTK2 gene expression in CLL8 patients yielded similar results . Furthermore , PTK2 inhibition blunted R-dependent cell death in vitro . This retrospective analysis from 2 independent trials revealed that increased PTK2 expression is associated with improved outcomes for CLL patients treated ***with*** ***R-FC*** ***vs*** ***FC*** . PTK2 expression may be a useful biomarker for patient selection in future trials . These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT00090051 ( REACH ) and # NCT00281918 ( CLL8 ) .
