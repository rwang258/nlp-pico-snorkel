A ~~double-blind~~ randomized ~~controlled~~ trial of oral **misoprostol** and intramuscular syntometrine in the management of the third stage of labor . BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral ~~misoprostol~~ 400 mug with intramuscular syntometrine in the management of the third stage of labor . MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a ~~double-blind~~ randomized ~~controlled~~ trial conducted in a tertiary care hospital . Three hundred and fifty-five women randomized to receive either ***oral*** **misoprostol** ***400*** ***mug*** ***or*** ***intramuscular*** ***syntometrine*** in the third stage of labor were studied . The change in hemoglobin level from before to 48 h after delivery , use of additional oxytocics and ~~treatment~~ related side effects were the main outcome measures . RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the change in hemoglobin level and mean blood loss . The incidence of shivering was significantly higher in the ***misoprostol*** group whilst that of vomiting was significantly higher in the ***syntometrine*** group . There were no differences in the incidence of nausea , headache , diarrhea and pyrexia between the two groups . CONCLUSION Orally administered **misoprostol** at a dose of 400 mug is an acceptable alternative in preventing post-partum blood loss , as measured by the peri-partum change in hemoglobin level and was not associated with an increased incidence of side effects .
