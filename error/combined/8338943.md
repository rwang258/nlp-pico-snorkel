Prevention of regimen-related toxicities after bone marrow transplantation by **pentoxifylline** ***:*** a prospective , randomized trial . Elevated levels of tumor necrosis ~~factor~~ alpha ( TNF-alpha ) have been reported to correlate with the development of transplant-related complications after bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . In a recent phase I-II trial , oral administration of **pentoxifylline** ***(*** ***PTX*** ***)*** , a xanthine ~~derivative~~ capable of downregulating TNF-alpha production in vitro , was reported to ~~reduce~~ morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing BMT . We conducted a prospective randomized trial of PTX ~~therapy~~ among 140 patients undergoing either ~~allogeneic~~ ( n = 51 ) or ~~autologous~~ BMT ( n = 89 ) . Patients were randomized to receive ( n = 70 ) or not receive ( n = 70 ) oral ***PTX*** , 1,600 mg/d in four divided ~~doses~~ from day -8 until day + 100 post-BMT . The incidence of mucositis requiring ~~morphine~~ ~~sulfate~~ ( MSO4 ) was similar in both ~~groups~~ ( 42.9 % ) , with the mean number of days with MSO4 being 7.8 ( SD = 3.4 ) in the PTX group versus 8.2 ( SD = 3.4 ) in the control group ( NS ) . The incidence of renal insufficiency was not affected by ***PTX*** administration ( 15.7 % in the PTX group v 21.4 % in the control group [ NS ] ) and the highest serum creatinine value during the first 100 days post-BMT was 119 mumol/L ( SD = 82.4 ) in the PTX group versus 103.9 mumol/L ( SD = 57 ) in the control group ( NS ) . The incidence of grade > or = 2 graft-versus-host disease was similar in each group ( 11/25 [ 44 % ] in the ***PTX*** group v 12/26 [ 46 % ] in the control group ) . No significant difference was observed in hematologic toxicity , transfusion requirements , duration of fever , and hepatic toxicity between the treatment groups . In conclusion , our study failed to show a prophylactic effect of ***PTX*** in transplant-related toxicities after BMT . On the basis of these findings , we can not recommend that ***PTX*** be part of early mortality and morbidity prevention programs after BMT .
