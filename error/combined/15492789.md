**Single** **nucleotide** ***polymorphism*** in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha gene in colorectal carcinoma . Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in the world , and its incidence has increased in recent years . We have reported that expression of hypoxia-inducible ~~factor~~ ( HIF ) -1alpha correlates with expression of vascular endothelial growth ~~factor~~ ( VEGF ) , tumor stage , lymphatic invasion , ~~venous~~ invasion , and liver metastasis . It has also been reported that a **single** **nucleotide** ***polymorphism*** ***(*** ***SNP*** ***)*** in exon 12 of HIF-1alpha gene is present in renal cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients . We investigated the ***C1772T*** ***polymorphism*** in colorectal cancer patients and healthy ~~control~~ subjects to clarify the mechanism of ***HIF-1alpha*** ***activation*** in colorectal carcinoma . The exon 12 genotype was not associated with sex or age . The distribution of HIF-1alpha genotypes in controls was 89 C/C ( 89 % ) , 11 C/T ( 11 % ) , and 0 T/T ( 0 % ) . The distribution of HIF-1alpha genotypes in colorectal cancer patients was 100 C/C ( 100 % ) , 0 C/T ( 0 % ) , and 0 T/T ( 0 % ) . The difference in genotype distribution between patients and **control** subjects was significant ( p < 0.0005 ) . These results suggest that the ***C1772T*** polymorphism in HIF-1alpha is not involved in progression or metastasis of colorectal carcinoma .
