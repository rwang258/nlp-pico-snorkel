A randomized **controlled** trial assessing the health economics of realtime teledermatology compared **with** conventional care : an urban versus rural perspective . A randomized **controlled** trial was carried out to measure the cost-effectiveness of realtime teledermatology compared with conventional outpatient dermatology care for patients from urban and rural areas . One urban and one rural health centre were linked to a regional hospital in Northern Ireland by ISDN at 128 kbit/s . Over two years , 274 patients required a hospital outpatient dermatology referral -- 126 patients ( 46 % ) were randomized to a telemedicine consultation and 148 ( 54 % ) to a conventional hospital outpatient consultation . Of those seen by telemedicine , 61 % were **registered** with an urban practice , compared with 71 % of those seen conventionally . The clinical outcomes of the two types of consultation were similar -- almost half the patients were managed after a single consultation with the dermatologist . The observed marginal cost per patient of the initial **realtime** **teledermatology** **consultation** was 52.85 Pounds for those in urban areas and 59.93 Pounds per patient for those from rural areas . The observed marginal cost of the initial **conventional** **consultation** was 47.13 Pounds for urban patients and 48.77 Pounds for rural patients . The total observed costs of **teledermatology** were higher than the costs of **conventional** **care** in both urban and rural areas , mainly because of the fixed equipment costs . Sensitivity analysis using a real-world scenario showed that in urban areas the average costs of the **telemedicine** and **conventional** **consultations** were about equal , while in rural areas the average cost of the **telemedicine** **consultation** was less than that of the **conventional** **consultation** **.**
