**Dose-response** effect of flecainide in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and/or flutter monitored with trans-telephonic electrocardiography : a multicenter , **placebo-controlled** , **double-blind** trial . BACKGROUND A **double-blind** , randomized , parallel-group , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter ( PAF/PAFL ) experiencing 2 or more episodes of symptomatic PAF/PAFL during a **28-day** observation period to **determine** the **dose-response** effect and safety of flecainide . METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 143 patients at 30 centers were randomized to receive 25 , 50 , or 100 mg of flecainide **or** placebo twice daily ( BID ) . In 123 patients ( per protocol set ) , those remaining free from PAF/PAFL after the **treatment** were 3.1 % on placebo , 7.7 % on 25 mg/BID , 9.4 % on 50 mg/BID , and 39.4 % on 100 mg/BID of flecainide **.** As a whole group , a significant linear dose-response ( p < 0.001 ) was observed and a significant difference between placebo and 100 mg/BID was observed ( p < 0.001 ) . A similar dose-response between the present study and Caucasian study was demonstrated . Although there were 5 patients who needed cardioversion or ablation because of frequent episodes of PAF/PAFL ( 2 in 25 mg/BID , 1 in 50 mg/BID , and 2 in 100 mg/BID of flecainide **)** , neither death nor ventricular proarrhythmic event was reported . CONCLUSIONS This study indicated that flecainide exerted a significant dose-dependent effect on the prevention of symptomatic PAF/PAFL recurrence and showed that there was no inter-ethnic difference in the clinical effect of flecainide in patients with PAF/PAFL .
