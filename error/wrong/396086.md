Effect of increasing **doses** of labetalol on blood pressure , **plasma** renin activity and **aldosterone** in hypertensive patients . 1 . Four different **doses** of labetalol ( 150 , 300 , 600 and 900 mg/day ) were given for 1 week to each of four **groups** of patients with **essential** hypertension ( six patients for each group ) . 2 . Labetalol decreased mean blood pressure and heart rate to the same extent on the first and the seventh days of **treatment** . Only standing blood pressure showed a **dose-dependent** inhibition both in the supine and upright position . 3 . Labetalol exerted a net inhibitory effect on **plasma** renin activity , which was related to basal renin values and was already maximal at the lowest **doses** . This effect was well maintained in the supine position . This effect was well maintained in the supine position , although during standing it tended to be less evident with increasing doses . 4 . Urinary aldosterone was decreased in a dose-dependent fashion and its changes were largely independent fashion and its changes were largely independent of plasma renin activity . 5 . Neither basal values nor changes of renin and aldosterone were related to the hypotensive effect of labetalol **.** 6 . During labetalol treatment urinary sodium excretion fell for 2-3 days and then returned to basal values . The retentive effect of **labetalol** on sodium was directly related to the decrease of blood pressure , and the successive sodium escape might be explained either by the observed increase of plasma volume ( indirectly measured by packed cell volume ) or by aldosterone inhibition .
