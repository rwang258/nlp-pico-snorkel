Vitamin C and acute illness in Navajo school **children** . To evaluate earlier observations , including our own , showing usefulness of vitamin C for managing the common cold , we performed a **double-blind** trial of vitamin C versus placebo in 868 **children** . There was no difference in number becoming ill ( 133 versus 129 ) , number of episodes ( 166 versus 159 ) or mean illness duration ( 5.5 versus 5.8 days ) between the **groups** . **Children** receiving **vitamin** C had fewer throat cultures yielding beta-hemolytic streptococcus ( six versus 13 , P less than 0.10 ) , but no difference in overall complicated illness rate ( 24 versus 25 ) . Plasma ascorbic acid levels were higher in the vitamin group 24 to 26 hours after supplementation ( 1.28 versus 1.04 mg per 100 ml , P less than 0.01 ) . Children with high plasma ascorbic acid concentrations had longer mean illness ( 6.8 versus 4.0 days , P less than 0.05 ) than those with low levels . Vitamin **C** does not seem to be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent for upper respiratory illness .
