Oscillatory potentials , **retinopathy** , and long-term **glucose** **control** in insulin-dependent diabetes . The main objective of the study was to assess effects of long-term lowering **of** glucosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1 % ) on neurosensory function in insulin-dependent diabetes . Individual ( OP-1 , OP-2 , OP-3 ) **and** summed ( OP-sum ) amplitudes **of** oscillatory potentials ( OPs ) **of** electroretinography **were** recorded at study start and 7-years later in 45 patients ( the Oslo study ) . As an overall 7-year change , amplitudes of OP-2 , OP-3 and OP-sum were **reduced** ( p < 0.0001-0.01 ) , **retinopathy** **worsened** ( p = 0.005 ) , intraocular pressure decreased ( p < 0.001 ) , systolic blood pressure increased ( p < 0.0002 ) , and glycemic **control** improved from HbA1 of 11.2 +/- 2.2 % at study start to a 7-year cumulative mean of 9.5 +/- 1.5 % ( p < 0.0001 ) . Multiple regression analysis did not identify any independent relations between change in OP-1 , OP-2 , OP-3 , OP-sum and change in glycemic **control** or background variables , including change in age and duration of diabetes . However , cross-sectional observations at 7 years showed negative correlations between all OPs and age ( p < 0.0001-0.003 ) , and between OP-3 and duration ( p = 0.003 ) and counts of microaneurysms ( p = 0.02 ) . The data suggest that various clinical background variables may influence individual and summed amplitudes of OPs differently . Reduced neurosensory retinal function ( OPs ) seemed to appear after 7-years , independently of vascular defects of retinopathy and long-term improvement in glucose **control** .
