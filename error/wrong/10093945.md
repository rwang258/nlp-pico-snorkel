A comparative study of ofloxacin and cefixime for **treatment** of **typhoid** fever in **children** . The Dong Nai **Pediatric** Center **Typhoid** Study Group . BACKGROUND Despite concerns about safety in **children** , fluoroquinolone antibiotics have become the **treatment** of choice in patients with **multidrug-resistant** **typhoid** fever in Vietnam . However , **quinolone-resistant** strains of Salmonella typhi have recently been reported from Vietnam ; and if **quinolone** resistance becomes established , alternative oral **treatment** options will be needed . OBJECTIVE Cefixime , an orally **administered** third generation cephalosporin , was compared with ofloxacin for the **treatment** of uncomplicated **typhoid** fever in **children** . METHODS In an open trial **children** with suspected **typhoid** fever were randomized to receive either ofloxacin ( 10 mg/kg/day in two divided **doses** ) for 5 days or cefixime ( 20 mg/kg/day in two divided **doses** ) for 7 days . RESULTS S. typhi was isolated from 82 patients ( 44 in the **cefixime** group , 38 in the ofloxacin group ) and 70 ( 85 % ) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant . Median ( 95 % confidence interval , range ) fever clearance times were 4.4 ( 4 to 5.2 , 0.2 to 9.9 ) days for ofloxacin recipients and 8.5 ( 4.2 to 9 , 1.8 to 15.2 ) days for **cefixime-treated** patients ( P < 0.0001 ) . There were 11 treatment failures ( 10 acute and one relapse ) in the **cefixime** group and 1 acute treatment failure in the ofloxacin group ( mean difference , 22 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 9 to 36 % ) . CONCLUSION Short course treatment with cefixime may provide a useful alternative treatment in cases of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children , but it is less effective than short course treatment with ofloxacin **.**
