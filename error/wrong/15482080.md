Transitions during effective **treatment** for **cocaine-abusing** homeless persons : establishing abstinence , lapse , and relapse , and reestablishing abstinence . Data are reported on drug use among **cocaine-dependent** homeless persons who participated in a clinical trial that compared day treatment **only** ( DT , n = 69 ) with day treatment plus abstinent-contingent housing **and** work ( DT+ , n = 72 ) . Drug use was measured with multiple **weekly** urine toxicologies . Compared with DT participants , more DT+ participants established **abstinence** , maintained abstinence for longer durations , were marginally significantly more likely to lapse , and significantly less likely to relapse . Of all participants who established abstinence and then relapsed , DT+ participants relapsed later and were more likely to reestablish abstinence . These analyses yield information on the processes involved in the manner in which drug use changes as a result of **abstinent-contingent** **housing** **and** **work** **.**
