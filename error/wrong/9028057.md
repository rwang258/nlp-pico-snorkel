Opioid-immune interactions in autism : behavioural and immunological assessment during a **double-blind** **treatment** with naltrexone . The emerging **concept** of opioid **peptides** as a new class of **chemical** messengers of the neuroimmune axis and the presence of a number of immunological abnormalities in infantile autism prompted us to correlate biological ( hormonal and immunological ) **determinations** and behavioural performances during **treatment** with the potent opiate antagonist , naltrexone ( NAL ) . Twelve autistic patients ranging from 7 to 15 years , diagnosed according to DSM-III-R , entered a double-blind crossover study **with** NAL **at** **the** doses **of** 0.5 , 1.0 **and** 1.5 mg/kg every 48 hours . **The** behavioural evaluation **was** conducted using **the** specific BSE **and** CARS rating **scales** **NAL** treatment **produced** **a** **significant** reduction **of** **the** **autistic** **symptomatology** **in** **seven** **(** **"** **responders** **"** **)** **out** **of** **12** children **.** The behavioural improvement was accompanied by alterations in the distribution of the major lymphocyte subsets , with a significant increase of the T-helper-inducers ( CD4+CD8- ) and a significant reduction of the T-cytotoxic-suppressor ( CD4-CD8+ ) resulting in a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio . Changes in natural killer cells and activity were inversely related to plasma beta-endorphin levels . It is suggested that the mechanisms underlying opioid-immune interactions are altered in this population of autistic children and that an immunological screening may have prognostic value for the **pharmacological** therapy **with** **opiate** **antagonists** **.**
