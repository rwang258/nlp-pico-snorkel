Why does lag affect the durability of memory-based automaticity : loss of memory **strength** or interference ? In Rickard , Lau , and Pashler 's ( 2008 ) investigation of the lag effect on memory-based automaticity , response times were **faster** and proportion of trials retrieved was higher at the end of practice for short lag items than for long lag items . However , during testing **after** **a** delay , response times were slower and proportion of trials retrieved was lower for short lag items than for long lag items . The current study investigated the extent to which the lag effect on the durability of memory-based automaticity is due to interference or to the loss of memory strength with time . Participants repeatedly practiced **alphabet** **subtraction** **items** **in** **short** **lag** **and** **long** **lag** **conditions** **.** After practice , half of the participants were **immediately** **tested** and the other half were **tested** **after** **a** **7-day** **delay** **.** Results indicate that the lag effect on the durability of memory-based automaticity is primarily due to interference . We discuss potential modification of current memory-based processing theories to account for these effects .
