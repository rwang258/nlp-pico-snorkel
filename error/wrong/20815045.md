Comparison of three-year clinical outcomes between sirolimus-versus paclitaxel-eluting stents in diabetic patients : prospective randomized multicenter trial . BACKGROUND Three-year follow-up of major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) ( death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , target lesion revascularization ) and the **predictors** of MACEs in diabetic patients after sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) **or** paclitaxel-eluting stent ( PES ) implantation have not been reported . METHODS Diabetic patients with de novo coronary lesions ( 169 patients with 190 lesions ) were randomly assigned prospectively to either SES **or** PES . RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between the two **groups** . The rates of MACEs [ 5.9 % ( n = 5 ) in the SES vs. 9.5 % ( n = 8 ) in the **PES** Group , P = 0.374 ] and definite stent thrombosis [ 1.2 % ( n = 1 ) in the **SES** vs. 3.6 % ( n = 3 ) in the **PES** Group , P = 0.368 ] were similar in the two groups during the three-year follow-up . Multivariate logistic analysis showed that insulin treatment was the only independent predictor of MACE [ odds ratio ( OR ) 8.60 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 3.25-22.76 , P < 0.001 ] and target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) ( OR 9.50 , 95 % CI 3.07-29.44 , P < 0.001 ) during the three-year follow-up . CONCLUSIONS The rates of MACEs , TVR , and stent thrombosis during the three-year follow-up were similar in the **SES** **and** **PES** Groups . Insulin treatment was a main predictor of MACEs and TVR during the three-year follow-up after either **SES** or **PES** implantation .
