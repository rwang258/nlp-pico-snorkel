Aripiprazole **treatment** of irritability associated with autistic disorder and the relationship between prior antipsychotic **exposure** , adverse events , and weight change . OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of prior antipsychotic **exposure** ( PAE ) on safety and tolerability outcomes in **pediatric** subjects receiving **aripiprazole** **treatment** . METHODS This study was a post-hoc analysis of **pooled** data from two 8-week , **double-blind** , randomized , placebo-controlled studies evaluating aripiprazole for the **treatment** of irritability in **pediatric** subjects with autistic disorder , aged 6-17 years . Subjects were stratified by PAE ; adverse events ( AEs ) , and changes in weight , and metabolic measures were evaluated . For subjects receiving **aripiprazole** , regardless of PAE , baseline weight , age , gender , and **symptom** severity were evaluated in a regression model **predicting** body weight change . RESULTS Of 316 randomized subjects , 259 ( 82.0 % ) were antipsychotic na√Øve ( AN ) and 57 ( 18.0 % ) had a PAE . **Aripiprazole-treated** AN subjects were more likely than PAE subjects to report somnolence ( 11.9 % vs. 2.8 % ) , sedation ( 22.7 % vs. 11.1 % ) , or fatigue ( 17.0 % vs. 13.9 % ) . Rates of extrapyramidal disorder and drooling , but not akathisia or tremor , were marginally higher in AN subjects . Overall , 10.8 % of aripiprazole-treated AN subjects had at least one AE leading to discontinuation compared with 8.3 % of aripiprazole-treated PAE subjects . AN subjects receiving **aripiprazole** had a larger change in weight from baseline to endpoint compared with those receiving placebo ( 1.9 vs. 0.7 kg ; treatment difference 1.2 kg , 95 % CI : 0.5 , 1.9 ) than PAE subjects receiving **aripiprazole** compared with subjects receiving placebo ( 0.4 vs. -0.4 kg ; treatment difference 0.9 kg , 95 % CI : -0.6 , 2.4 ) . Regression analysis identified that younger subjects with higher baseline weight z-score were at highest risk for weight gain . There were no significant changes in metabolic measures compared with placebo in either group . CONCLUSIONS Weight gain was more pronounced in AN subjects and more likely to occur in younger subjects with a higher baseline weight z-score . AN subjects were more likely to experience AEs related to somnolence . However , based on discontinuations rates from AEs , overall tolerability was good for both AN and PAE groups .
