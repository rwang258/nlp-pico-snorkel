Should insertion of intramedullary nails for tibial fractures be with or without reaming ? A prospective , randomized study with 3.8 years ' follow-up . OBJECTIVE To **determine** if any differences exist in healing and complications between reamed **and** unreamed nailing in patients with tibial shaft fractures . DESIGN Prospective , randomized . SETTING Level 1 trauma center . PATIENTS Forty-five patients with displaced closed and open Gustilo type I-IIIA fractures of the central two thirds of the tibia . **INTERVENTION** Stabilization **of** tibial fractures either **with** **a** slotted , stainless steel reamed nail **or** **a** solid , titanium unreamed nail . MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Nonunions , time to fracture healing , and rate of malunions . RESULTS The average time to fracture healing was 16.7 weeks in the **reamed** group and 25.7 weeks in the **unreamed** group . The difference was statistically significant ( P = 0.004 ) . There were three nonunions , all in the **unreamed** **nail** group . Two of these fractures healed after dynamization by removing **static** interlocking screws . The third nonunion did not heal despite exchange **reamed** nailing 2 years after the primary surgery and dynamization with a fibular osteotomy after an additional 1 year . There were two malunions in the **reamed** group and four malunions in the **unreamed** group . There were no differences for all other outcome measurements . CONCLUSION **Unreamed** **nailing** **in** patients with tibial shaft fractures may be associated with higher rates of secondary operations and malunions compared with **reamed** **nailing** **.** The time to fracture healing was significantly longer with **unreamed** **nails** **.**
