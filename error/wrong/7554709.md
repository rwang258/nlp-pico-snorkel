Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor mofegiline assessed during a phase I **dose** tolerance trial . The safety , pharmacokinetics , **and** pharmacodynamics **of** single oral doses **of** **up** **to** 48 mg **and** daily ( **for** 28 days ) doses **of** **up** 24 mg mofegiline were investigated in healthy male volunteers . **Plasma** pharmacokinetics indicated rapid absorption and elimination : time to reach maximum concentration occurred at about 1 hour ; half-life ranged from 1 to 3 hours . Maximal **plasma** concentration and area under the **plasma** concentration-time curve increased and oral clearance decreased disproportionately with **dose** . Mofegiline rapidly and markedly inhibited platelet monoamine oxidase B ( MAOB ) activity , which returned to baseline within 14 days . Urinary excretion of phenylethylamine increased proportionately with doses up to 24 mg. No changes in urinary elimination of catecholamines , blood pressure , heart rate , or ECG were observed . A classic maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in these studies . However , the 48 mg single dose and the 24 mg multiple daily dose far exceeded the dose ( 1 mg ) that was associated with > 90 % platelet MAOB inhibition .
