Epinephrine-induced panic attacks and hyperventilation . To assess the effects of epinephrine on ventilation in patients with panic disorder and in social phobics , analyses were performed on **pooled** data from two previous **infusion** studies . Throughout the **infusion** , changes in transcutaneous PCO2 ( tcPCO2 ) , subjective anxiety , heart rate and blood pressure were recorded continuously . Twenty-nine patients received epinephrine , ten patients received placebo . Thirteen patients ( 45 % ) had a panic attack during epinephrine . The fall in tcPCO2 and the cardiovascular response was greater in panicking patients than patients who did not panic . Although the fall in tcPCO2 associated with panic was not substantial and did not indicate clinically significant acute hyperventilation , it appears to be a sensitive index for epinephrine-induced panic . The fall in tcPCO2 was predicted rather by the frequency of occurrence of anxiety-related somatic symptoms than by the fear of these symptoms . These findings further reduce a role for fear of bodily sensations in **epinephrine-induced** panic attacks and favor a biological sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation .
