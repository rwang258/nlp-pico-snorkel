Clinical outcome of postoperative **adjuvant** **immunochemotherapy** with sizofiran for patients with resectable gastric cancer : a randomised **controlled** study . Adjuvant immunochemotherapy using **the** antitumour polysaccharide sizofiran ( SPG ) , an **extract** from the **culture** broth of Schizophyllum commune Fries , was prescribed randomly for 386 **Japanese** patients with resectable gastric cancer . Although the overall survival probability for 5 years did not **differ** between the SPG and **control** **groups** , in 264 patients with curatively resected cancer , the probability to 5 year survival and to recurrence in the **sizofiran-administered** patients was better than in the **controls** . In the multivariate analysis , four of six prognostic factors correlated with the prognosis of the 264 patients who underwent curative surgery , that is , nodal involvement ( chi 2 = 21.426 , P = less than 0.0001 ) , age distribution ( chi 2 = 9.262 , P = 0.010 ) , sizofiran administration ( chi 2 = 6.507 , P = 0.011 ) , and primary tumour size ( chi 2 = 9.345 , P = 0.025 ) . Thus , patients with a curatively resected gastric cancer had a better prognosis when **sizofiran** was prescribed in combination with antitumour drugs .
