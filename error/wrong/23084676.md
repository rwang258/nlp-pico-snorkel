Hemostasis by bipolar coagulation versus suture after surgical stripping of bilateral ovarian endometriomas : a randomized **controlled** trial . STUDY OBJECTIVE To **estimate** whether the suture **of** **the** ovary is superior to bipolar coagulation in preserving ovarian **reserve** in infertile women undergoing laparoscopic stripping **of** bilateral endometriomas . DESIGN Randomized **controlled** trial ( Canadian Task Force classification I ) . SETTING University teaching hospital . PATIENTS 100 patients with bilateral endometriomas . **INTERVENTIONS** Patients underwent stripping **of** bilateral endometriomas and were randomized to undergo hemostasis by use of either laparoscopic suturing ( **LS** group ) **or** bipolar coagulation ( **BC** group ) . Changes in ovarian **reserve** were investigated by measuring the levels of anti-Mullerian **hormone** ( AMH ) and basal **follicle-stimulating** **hormone** ( FSH ) before **surgery** and at 3 , 6 and 12 months from **surgery** . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS At 3-month , 6-month , and 12-month follow-up , in both study groups , postsurgical AMH levels were significantly lower and basal FSH levels were significantly higher than before surgery . There was no significant difference in the mean percentage decrease of AMH levels in the **BC** group and **LS** group at 3- , 6- , and 12-month follow-up . The mean percentage increase in basal FSH was higher in the **BC** group than in the **LS** group at both 3-month ( p = .023 ) and 6-month follow-up ( p = .029 ) , but not at 12-month follow-up . Pregnancy rate , time to conception , and rate of endometrioma recurrence was similar in the 2 study groups . CONCLUSION **Laparoscopic** **stripping** **of** **ovarian** **endometriotic** **cyst** significantly decreases serum AMH levels and increases basal FSH levels independent from the method used to obtain hemostasis on the ovarian tissue .
