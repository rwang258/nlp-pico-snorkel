Alinidine in chronic stable angina : the effect on diastolic perfusion time . The present study has been performed to assess the effects of alinidine on diastolic duration during exercise in chronic coronary **artery** disease . Twelve male patients with stable effort angina and without previous myocardial infarction were studied . They received alinidine **or** placebo in a **double-blind** randomized crossover trial for 3 days after a wash-out period of 4 days . Alinidine was **administered** at a dosage of 30 mg 3 times a day . At the end of each **treatment** the patients underwent upright bicycle exercise . Left ventricular time intervals were obtained by means of **carotid** thermistor plethysmography . Diastolic duration was calculated by subtracting the electromechanical systole from the R-R interval and expressed as a percentage of the cardiac cycle ( % D ) . Alinidine increased both total exercise duration from 246.7 +/- 120.7 to 346.6 +/- 114.1 s ( p less than 0.05 ) and time to 0.1-mV ST segment depression from 98.3 +/- 53 to 187.2 +/- 105 s ( p less than 0.05 ) . Similarly the drug induced a reduction of the rate-pressure product and of the extent of ischemic ST segment depression during exercise . % D was increased by alinidine both at rest and during exercise . A direct linear regression between R-R and % D was found after both **alinidine** and placebo treatments either at rest or during exercise . Nevertheless , no difference was observed between both slopes and intercepts . Therefore , since the relationship between R-R interval and % D was unaffected by **alinidine** , it was possible to hypothesize that the changes in diastolic duration were due only to the bradycardic action of the drug .
