Cognitive control therapy **and** transcranial direct current stimulation for depression : a randomized , **double-blinded** , **controlled** trial . BACKGROUND Based on findings that major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is associated to decreased dorsolateral prefrontal **cortical** ( DLPFC ) activity ; **interventions** that increase DLPFC activity might theoretically present **antidepressant** effects . Two of them are cognitive control therapy ( CCT ) , a neurocognitive **intervention** that uses computer-based working memory exercises , and transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , which delivers weak , electric direct currents over the scalp . METHODS We investigated whether tDCS enhanced the effects of CCT in a **double-blind** trial , in which participants were randomized to sham tDCS **and** CCT ( n=17 ) vs. active tDCS **and** CCT ( n=20 ) . CCT and tDCS were applied for 10 consecutive workdays . Clinicaltrials.gov identifier : NCT01434836 . RESULTS Both CCT alone and combined with tDCS ameliorated depressive symptoms after the acute treatment period and at follow-up , with a response rate of approximately 25 % . Older patients and those who presented better performance in the task throughout the trial ( possibly indicating greater engagement and activation of the DLPFC ) had greater depression improvement in the combined treatment group . LIMITATIONS Our exploratory findings should be further confirmed in prospective controlled trials . DISCUSSION CCT and tDCS combined might be beneficial for older depressed patients , particularly for those who have cognitive resources to adequately learn and improve task performance over time . This combined therapy might be specifically relevant in this subgroup that is more prone to present cognitive decline and prefrontal cortical atrophy .
