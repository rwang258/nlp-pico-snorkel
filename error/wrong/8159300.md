Cyclosporin versus cyclophosphamide for patients with **steroid-dependent** and frequently relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome : a multicentre randomized **controlled** trial . OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy ( maintenance of remission ) , safety and tolerability of cyclosporin ( CsA ) with those of cyclophosphamide in patients with **steroid-dependent** or frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) . DESIGN Open , prospective , randomized , multicentre , **controlled** study for parallel **groups** , stratified for adults and **children** . The setting was in nephrological departments in Italy . SUBJECTS AND **INTERVENTIONS** Seventy-three patients with **steroid-sensitive** idiopathic NS admitted to the study were randomly assigned to cyclophosphamide ( 2.5 mg/kg/day ) for 8 weeks or CsA ( 5 mg/kg/day in adults , 6 mg/kg/day in **children** ) for 9 months , tapered off by 25 % every month until **complete** discontinuation at month 12 . Seven patients lost to follow up were not considered in the analysis . The remaining 66 patients were followed up for 3-24 months after randomization . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relapse-free survival ; number of N.S . relapses/patient/year ; cumulative **dose** of **prednisone/patient** ; laboratory investigations ( **kidney** and liver functions , haematological parameters ) ; incidence of adverse events . RESULTS At month 9 , 26 of 35 CsA-treated patients were still in complete remission and a further five patients were in partial remission ; 18 of 28 **cyclophosphamide-treated** patients were in complete remission , and one in partial remission ( P = NS ) . No difference between adults and children was seen with either treatment . The risk of relapse was similar between frequent relapsers ( 19 of 22 ) and steroid-dependent patients ( 8 of 14 ) given CsA , and those given cyclophosphamide ( 5 of 15 and 6 of 15 ) . The mean number of relapses per year and the mean dose of **prednisone** per year were significantly less ( P < 0.001 ) in both groups for the experimental year than for the year before randomization . At 2 years , 25 % of the patients given **CsA** ( 50 % adults and 20 % children ) and 63 % of those given cyclophosphamide ( 40 % adults and 68 % children ) had not had any relapse of NS . Tolerance to the two drugs was generally good . The **CsA-related** side-effects were mild and disappeared after drug discontinuation . CONCLUSIONS This study shows that both treatments are effective and well tolerated ; more patients given cyclophosphamide had stable remissions .
