Quantifying the extent of osteonecrosis of the femoral head . A new **method** using MRI . In a randomised trial **comparing** core decompression with conservative **treatment** we tested the hypothesis that the extent of necrosis at the initial MRI **predicts** the subsequent risk of collapse of the femoral head . After the initial clinical evaluation , including plain radiography and MRI , 37 hips with early-stage osteonecrosis ( ON ) in 33 patients were randomly assigned to a **core-decompression** group **or** **a** **conservatively-treated** group . All were followed regularly by clinical evaluation , plain radiography and MRI at intervals of three months . The extent of ON was **estimated** on the basis of abnormal signal intensity in the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head as **determined** from a **combination** of coronal and sagittal MRIs . The arc of the necrotic portion in the mid-coronal image ( A ) and that in the mid-sagittal image ( B ) were used to quantify the extent of necrosis by the formula : ( A/180 ) x ( B/180 ) x 100 . There was a strong correlation between this index and the risk of collapse before and after adjustment for age , gender , stage and treatment group . We conclude that the extent of the necrotic portion ascertain by this method is a major predictor of future collapse . We propose a systematic method of determining the index of the necrotic portion which may be clinically useful in the management of early-stage ON of the femoral head .
