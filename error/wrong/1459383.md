The effects of **treatment** of urinary incontinence in general practice . A total of 110 women who had reported urinary incontinence to their general practitioners were randomly assigned to a **treatment** or **control** group . **Treatment** consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence . The results were measured after 3 and 12 months by a research **assistant** on the basis of a constructed severity scale , an incontinence diary , and a comparison by the patients themselves of their previous and current conditions . After 3 months the **control** group were given the same **treatment** . After a further 3 and 12 months , they were assessed in exactly the same way as the treatment group . After 3 months about 60 % of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent ; the mean number of wet episodes had gone down from 20 to 7 , and 74 % of the women felt improved or cured . These results were later corroborated by the control group . After 12 months this successful outcome was improved slightly further . It may be concluded that the majority of women with incontinence can be successfully treated by the general practitioner . The effect of this treatment continues after one year .
