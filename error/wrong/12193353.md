Local warming and insertion of peripheral **venous** cannulas : **single** **blinded** prospective randomised **controlled** trial and **single** **blinded** randomised crossover trial . OBJECTIVE To **determine** whether local warming of the lower arm and hand facilitates peripheral **venous** cannulation . DESIGN **Single** **blinded** prospective randomised **controlled** trial and **single** **blinded** randomised crossover trial . SETTING **Neurosurgical** unit and haematology ward of university hospital . PARTICIPANTS 100 **neurosurgical** patients and 40 patients with leukaemia who required **chemotherapy** . **INTERVENTIONS** **Neurosurgical** patients ' hands **and** forearms **were** covered **for** 15 minutes **with** **a** carbon fibre heating mitt . Patients were assigned randomly to active warming **at** 52 degrees C **or** passive insulation ( heater not **activated** ) . The same warming **system** was used for 10 minutes in patients with leukaemia . They were assigned randomly to **active** warming or passive insulation on day 1 and given alternative **treatment** during the subsequent visit . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES **PRIMARY** : success rate for insertion of 18 gauge cannula into vein on back of hand . SECONDARY : time required for successful cannulation . RESULTS In neurosurgical patients , it took 36 seconds ( 95 % confidence interval 31 to 40 seconds ) to insert a cannula in the active warming group and 62 ( 50 to 74 ) seconds in the passive insulation group ( P=0.002 ) . Three ( 6 % ) first attempts failed in the active warming group compared with 14 ( 28 % ) in the passive insulation group ( P=0.008 ) . The crossover study in patients with leukaemia showed that insertion time was reduced by 20 seconds ( 8 to 32 , P=0.013 ) with active warming and that failure rates at first attempt were 6 % with warming and 30 % with passive insulation ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Local warming facilitates the insertion of peripheral venous cannulas , reducing both time and number of attempts required . This may decrease the time staff spend inserting cannulas , reduce supply costs , and improve patient satisfaction .
