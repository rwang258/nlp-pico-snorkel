**Determinants** of improvement in walking capacity among individuals with chronic stroke following a multi-dimensional exercise program . OBJECTIVE To identify the **determinants** of improvement in walking capacity following therapeutic exercise in chronic stroke survivors . DESIGN A secondary analysis of data obtained from a prospective , **single-blind** , randomized **controlled** **intervention** trial . SUBJECTS Sixty-three community-dwelling individuals ( mean age = 65 years , age range = 50-87 years ) with a chronic stroke ( post-stroke duration : mean = 5.5 years , range = 1-28 years ) . METHODS Subjects were randomized into a leg **exercise** group ( n = 32 ) or an arm **exercise** group ( n = 31 ) . Subjects in each group underwent 3 1-hour exercise sessions per week for 19 weeks . Walking capacity , cardiorespiratory fitness , isometric knee extensor muscle strength , balance ability , and balance confidence were evaluated before and after the interventions . Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of improvement in walking capacity . RESULTS After controlling for age , gender , post-stroke duration , and baseline walking capacity , gain in paretic leg muscle strength and peak oxygen consumption remained independently associated with gain in walking capacity ( R2 = 0.229 ) . CONCLUSION Enhancement of cardiorespiratory fitness and paretic leg muscle strength are both significant determinants in improving walking capacity among chronic stroke survivors . However , the rather weak relationship ( R2 = 0.229 ) indicates that other factors not measured in this study may also contribute to the improvement in walking capacity .
