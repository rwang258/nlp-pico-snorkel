Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) or myalgic encephalomyelitis ( ME ) is different in **children** compared to in adults : a study of UK and Dutch clinical cohorts . OBJECTIVE To investigate differences between young **children** , **adolescents** and adults with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis ( CFS/ME ) . STUDY DESIGN Comparison of clinical cohorts from 8 paediatric and 27 adult CFS/ME services in the UK and a paediatric randomised **controlled** trial from the Netherlands . Outcome measures include : fatigue ( the UK-Chalder Fatigue Scale ) ; Disability ( the UK-SF-36 physical function subscale ; the Netherlands-CHQ-CF87 ) ; school attendance , pain , anxiety and depression ( the UK-Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale , Spence **Children** 's Anxiety Scale ; the Netherlands-Spielberger **State-Trait** Anxiety Inventory for **Children** , **Children** 's Depression Inventory ) ; symptoms ; time-to-assessment ; and body mass index . We used multinomial regression to compare younger ( aged < 12 years ) and older ( aged 12-18 years ) **children** with adults , and logistic regression to compare UK and Dutch **adolescents** . RESULTS Younger **children** had a more equal gender **balance** compared to **adolescents** and adults . Adults had more disability and fatigue , and had been ill for longer . Younger children were less likely to have cognitive symptoms ( OR 0.18 ( 95 % CI 0.13 to 0.25 ) ) and more likely to present with a sore throat ( OR 1.42 ( 1.07 to 1.90 ) . Adolescents were more likely to have headaches ( 81.1 % , OR 1.56 ( 1.36 % to 1.80 % ) ) and less likely to have tender lymph nodes , palpitations , dizziness , general malaise and pain , compared to adults . Adolescents were more likely to have comorbid depression ( OR 1.51 ( 1.33 to 1.72 ) ) and less likely to have anxiety ( OR 0.46 ( 0.41 to 0.53 ) ) compared to adults . CONCLUSIONS Paediatricians need to recognise that children with CFS/ME present differently from adults . Whether these differences reflect an underlying aetiopathology requires further investigation . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS FITNET trial registration numbers are ISRCTN59878666 and NCT00893438 . This paper includes secondary ( post-results ) analysis of data from this trial , but are unrelated to trial outcomes .
