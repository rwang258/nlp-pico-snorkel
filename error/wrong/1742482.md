**Recombinant** human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ameliorates **zidovudine-induced** **neutropenia** in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) /AIDS-related **complex** . To evaluate the effect of **recombinant** granulocyte-macrophage **colony-stimulating** **factor** ( GM-CSF ) on patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or AIDS-related **complex** ( ARC ) who were intolerant to **zidovudine** because of **neutropenia** , we performed a randomized , open-label study in which patients were assigned to one of two **groups** . Zidovudine **was** discontinued **in** group **A** patients **before** instituting GM-CSF treatment **and** **was** restarted **in** **a** graduated fashion **over** 4 weeks **.** Group B patients continued **on** full-dose ( 1,200 mg/d ) zidovudine therapy **while** beginning GM-CSF therapy . A total of 17 patients were entered , eight in group A and nine in group B . Five of eight patients in group A and seven of nine in group B had a history of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) . All were homosexual males , **except** one female in group A who was the sex partner of a bisexual male with AIDS . All patients had **neutropenia** ( absolute **neutrophil** count [ ANC ] less than 1,000/microL ) while taking **full-dose** **zidovudine** . The mean CD4 ( +/- SD ) **lymphocyte** level was 37 ( +/- 29 ) /microL and 39 ( +/- 44 ) /microL in **groups** A and B , respectively . After randomization , patients were begun on **subcutaneous** GM-CSF at a **dose** of 1.0 microgram/kg/d . Patients in group A received 2 weeks of daily GM-CSF , at which time **zidovudine** was restarted if the ANC was greater than 1,000/microL ; if the ANC was less than 1,000/microL , the dose of GM-CSF was increased to 3.0 micrograms/kg , and at 2-week intervals either **zidovudine** was restarted or the dose of GM-CSF was increased to 5 micrograms/kg and then 10 micrograms/kg , to maintain the ANC greater than 1,000/microL . Group B patients received full-dose **zidovudine** concurrently with GM-CSF administration . The dose of GM-CSF was increased every 2 weeks if necessary to keep the ANC greater than 1,000/microL while maintaining full-dose **zidovudine** therapy . Patients in each group showed an increase in total white blood cell ( WBC ) count . Neutrophils and eosinophils were responsible for the majority of this increase . Patients in group A had a more rapid increase in WBC than those in group B ; however , by week 8 , the WBC in each group was essentially equal . Viral replication as measured by human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) p24 antigen ( Ag ) was decreased in four patients in each group , increased in one patient in each group , and remained unchanged in the remainder . The ability to culture virus from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not changed by the regimen . The major toxicities of the regimen were fever and malaise . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
