Preventing disability and managing chronic illness in frail older adults : a randomized trial of a community-based partnership with **primary** care . BACKGROUND Effective new strategies that complement **primary** care are needed to **reduce** disability risks and improve self-management of chronic illness in frail older people living in the community . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a 1-year , senior center-based chronic illness self-management and disability prevention program on health , functioning , and healthcare utilization in frail older adults . DESIGN A randomized **controlled** trial . SETTING A large senior center located in a northeast Seattle suburb . The trial was conducted in collaboration with **primary** care providers of two large managed care organizations . PARTICIPANTS A total of 201 chronically ill older adults seniors aged 70 and older recruited through **medical** practices . **INTERVENTION** **A** targeted , multi-component disability prevention **and** disease self-management program led **by** **a** geriatric nurse practitioner ( GNP ) . MEASUREMENTS Self-reported Physical function , physical performance tests , health care utilization , and health behaviors . RESULTS Each of 101 **intervention** participants met with the GNP from 1 to 8 times ( median = 3 ) during the study year . The intervention group showed less decline in function , as measured by disability days and lower scores on the Health Assessment Questionnaire . Other measures of function , including the SF-36 and a battery of physical performance tests , did not change with the intervention . The number of hospitalized participants increased by 69 % among the controls and decreased by 38 % in the intervention group ( P = .083 ) . The total number of inpatient hospital days during the study year was significantly less in the intervention group compared with controls ( total days = 33 vs 116 , P = .049 ) . The intervention led to significantly higher levels of physical activity and senior center participation and significant reductions in the use of psychoactive medications . CONCLUSIONS This project provides evidence that a community-based collaboration with primary care providers can improve function and reduce inpatient utilization in chronically ill older adults . Linking organized medical care with complementary community-based interventions may be a promising direction for research and practice .
