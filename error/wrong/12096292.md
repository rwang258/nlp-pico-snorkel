Pain and fatigue management : results of a nursing randomized clinical trial . PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES Through a randomized clinical trial , to compare patients undergoing an initial course of chemotherapy who report pain and fatigue at baseline and who are receiving conventional care alone with those receiving conventional care plus **a** nursing intervention on outcomes reported at 20 weeks . SETTING **Chemotherapy** clinics of two comprehensive and two community cancer centers . METHODS Interviews were conducted at baseline and 10 and 20 weeks . An 18-week , 10-contact nursing intervention utilizing problem-solving approaches **to** symptom management **and** improving physical functioning **and** emotional health was implemented . SAMPLE The sample consisted of 53 patients in the experimental arm and 60 in the **control** arm who reported pain and fatigue at baseline . VARIABLES Pain and fatigue , numbers of other symptoms , and physical role impact and social-functioning subscales from the Medical Outcomes Study 36 Short Form . FINDINGS Patients who received the intervention reported a significant reduction in the number of symptoms experienced and improved physical and social functioning . Fewer patients in the experimental arm reported both pain and fatigue at 20 weeks . CONCLUSIONS **Behavioral** interventions targeted to patients with pain and fatigue can reduce symptom burden , improve the quality of the daily life of patients , and demonstrate the " value-added " role of **nursing** **care** for patients undergoing chemotherapy .
