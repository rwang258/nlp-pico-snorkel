A randomized study **comparing** the use of the Ligaclip with bipolar energy to prevent lymphocele during laparoscopic pelvic **lymphadenectomy** for gynecologic cancer . OBJECTIVE This prospective randomized pilot study compared the use of the Ligaclip ( **Ethicon** **Endo-Surgery** , Cincinnati , OH ) with bipolar **coagulation** in preventing lymphoceles after laparoscopic pelvic **lymphadenectomy** for gynecologic cancer . STUDY DESIGN Thirty patients with gynecologic malignancy , who had laparoscopic pelvic **lymphadenectomy** were randomly assigned for lymphadenectomy **in** 1 side **of** **the** pelvis using **the** Ligaclip , whereas , in the other side , the bipolar coagulation **to** seal lymphatic vessels was used . RESULTS At ultrasound examination , we detected lymphocele in 10 patients ( 33 % ) . Lymphocele developed in 9 ( 30 % ) patients on the side where laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was perfomed using bipolar coagulation , and in 1 ( 3.3 % ) patient on the side where laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed using the Ligaclip . Univariate analysis revealed that the Ligaclip 's use compared with electrocoagulation in the laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy is an independent predictive factor for development of lymphocele ( P = .006 ) . CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the use of the Ligaclip to close lymphatic vessels may reduce the incidence of lymphoceles in patients undergoing laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy .
