Evaluation of **three** dosage-prediction methods for initial in-hospital stabilization of warfarin therapy . **Three** dosage-prediction **methods** for initial in-hospital stabilization of warfarin therapy were evaluated . Adult inpatients who had received warfarin sodium **10** **mg** **daily** for less than three days were eligible for the study . After receiving their third warfarin dose , patients were randomly assigned to have their warfarin dosages adjusted using one of three dosage-prediction methods : by **analog** **computer** ( n = 31 ) , **linear** **regression** ( n = 22 ) , or **empiric** **dosing** **by** **the** **physician** ( n = 34 ) . A prothrombin time ( PT ) ratio ( patient PT divided by control PT ) between 1.3 and 2.5 was considered to be in the therapeutic range . For patients who achieved a stable PT ratio ( defined as a PT ratio between 1.3 and 2.5 that varied by less than 0.05 on two consecutive days or by less than 0.1 on three consecutive days without a dosage change ) before discharge , the number of days ( time to stabilization ) from administration of the first warfarin dose to achievement of the warfarin dosage that produced a stable PT ratio ( stabilization dosage ) was compared . A total of 54 patients met the study criteria for a stable PT ratio before hospital discharge ( analog computer , n = 20 ; linear regression , n = 15 ; empiric dosing , n = 19 ) . The mean times to stabilization were 6.8 days in the analog-computer group , 7.3 days in the linear-regression group , and 8.4 days in the empiric-dosing group ; these times were not significantly different . All 20 stabilized patients in the analog-computer group achieved a stable PT ratio by the fourth dosage prediction . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
