Effects of **stellate** **ganglionic** **block** on hemodynamic changes and intrapulmonary shunt in perioperative patients with esophageal cancer . OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to observe the effects **of** **stellate** **ganglion** **block** **(** **SGB** **)** on hemodynamic changes and intrapulmonary shunt during one-lung ventilation ( OLV ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty ASA class I-II patients undergoing elective esophageal surgery were randomly divided into two groups **:** **general** **anesthesia** **group** **(** **group** **N** **,** **n=15** **)** **and** **general** anesthesia combined **SGB** **group** **(** **group** **S** **,** **n=15** **)** **,** **patients** **in** **group** **S** **were** **received** **left** **SGB** **before** **induction** **.** **Radial** artery **was** **cannulated** **for** arterial **blood** **pressure** **(** **ABP** **)** **monitoring** **and** **blood** **sampling** **and** **Swan-Ganz** **catheter** **was** **position** **in** **the** **pulmonary** artery **via** **right** **internal** **jugular** **vein** **under** **local** anesthesia **.** **ECG** **,** **MAP** **,** **HR** **,** **CVP** **,** **continuous** **cardiac** **output** **(** **CCO** **)** **index** **and** **BIS** were continuously monitored during anesthesia . General anesthesia was induced with propofol 1.5-2.0 mg/kg , sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg , and Rocuronium 0.6-0.9 mg/kg . Endobronchial occluder was placed blindly after tracheal indubation and the correct position was verified by auscultation and fiberoptic bronchoscopy . The patients were mechanically ventilated . The ventilation conditions were Fio2=100 % , VT = 8-10 ml/kg , I : E = 1:2 and respiratory rate was adjusted to maintained PETCO2 at 35-45 mmHg during both two-lung ventilation ( TLV ) and OLV . Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol 4-10 mg/kg·h , sufentanil 0.2 μg/kg·h , vecuronium o.1 mg/kg·h , BIS was maintained at 45-55 . Blood samples were taken from radial artery and S-G catheter for blood gas analysis at following intervals : during spontaneous breathing when the patient was awake ( T0 ) , 1 min after tracheal indubation ( T1 ) , 1 min after patient was placed in lateral position ( T2 ) and 15 min after it ( T3 ) , 1 min after ribs was braced ( T4 ) , 30 , 60 , 120 min during the course of OLV ( T5 , T6 , T7 ) , the two lungs were ventilated again for 30 min ( T8 ) and Qs/Qt was calculated . RESULTS SVRI , MAP , HR in group N increased significantly at T1 , T2 , T4 compared with group S ( p < 0.05 ) . Qs/Qt was significantly increased after patient was placed in lateral position and increased further during OLV ; the calculated Qs/Qt values were highest at T5· PaO2 was significantly lower after OLV was started and reached the lowest level at T6 then was gradually increasing . There was no significant difference in Qs/Qt and PaO2 at all time points between two groups . **CONCLUSIONS** SGB before induction effectively suppress the stress response work as stable blood dynamics and does not affect Qs/Qt and arterial oxygenation during OLV , SGB is a safe technique of anesthesia for general thoracic surgery .
