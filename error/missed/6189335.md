Effect of betamethasone valerate on the normal human facial skin flora . Eighteen volunteers were randomly divided into two groups and allocated either an active corticosteroid preparation **(** Betamethasone valerate **)** or the **basal** **formulation** **only** **(** placebo **)** **.** The cream was applied to the face twice daily for one month . The treated area was sampled by the scrub-wash method immediately before treatment began and after 2 and 4 weeks , and microorganisms were enumerated and identified . Application of either cream produced a very slight increase ( less than or equal to 0.5 log cycle ) in the skin flora during the first 2 weeks of treatment . There were no significant differences in the changes occurring between volunteers treated with placebo and those on the steroid formulation . The results are discussed in relation to theories of pathogenesis of perioral dermatitis and steroid acne .
