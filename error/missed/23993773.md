**Behavioral** **parent** **training** to address sleep disturbances in young children with autism spectrum disorder : a pilot trial . OBJECTIVES A large percentage of children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) have bedtime and sleep disturbances . However , the treatment of these disturbances has been understudied . The purpose of our study was to develop a **manualized** **behavioral** **parent** **training** ( BPT ) program for parents of young children with ASD and sleep disturbances and to test the feasibility , fidelity , and initial efficacy of the treatment in a small randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) . PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Parents of a sample of 40 young children diagnosed with ASD with an average age of 3.5years were enrolled in our study . Participants were randomized to either the **BPT** **program** **group** **or** **a** **comparison** **group** **who** **were** **given** **nonsleep-related** **parent** **education** **.** Each participant was individually administered a 5-session program delivered over the 8-week study . Outcome measures of feasibility , fidelity , and efficacy were collected at weeks 4 and 8 after the baseline time point . Children 's sleep was assessed by parent report and objectively by actigraphy . RESULTS Of the 20 participants in each group , data were available for 15 participants randomized to BPT and 18 participants randomized to the comparison condition . Results supported the feasibility of the manualized parent training program and the comparison program . Treatment fidelity was high for both groups . The BPT program group significantly improved more than the comparison group based on the primary sleep outcome of parent report . There were no objective changes in sleep detected by actigraphy . CONCLUSIONS Our study is one of few RCTs of a BPT program to specifically target sleep disturbances in a well-characterized sample of young children with ASD and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach . Initial efficacy favored the BPT program over the comparison group and suggested that this manualized parent training approach is worthy of further examination of the efficacy within a larger RCT .
