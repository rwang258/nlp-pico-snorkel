Efficacy and safety of a **very-low-protein** **diet** when postponing dialysis in the elderly : a prospective randomized multicenter controlled study . BACKGROUND A **supplemented** **very-low-protein** **diet** **(** **sVLPD** **)** seems to be safe when postponing dialysis therapy . STUDY DESIGN Prospective multicenter randomized controlled study designed to assess the noninferiority of **diet** versus **dialysis** in 1-year mortality assessed by using **intention-to-treat** and per-protocol analysis . SETTING & PARTICIPANTS Italian uremic patients without diabetes older than 70 years with glomerular filtration rate of 5 to 7 mL/min ( 0.08 to 0.12 mL/s ) . INTERVENTION Randomization to an **sVLPD** **(** **diet** **group** **)** or **dialysis** **.** The **sVLPD** is a vegan diet ( 35 kcal ; proteins , 0.3 g/kg body weight daily ) supplemented with keto-analogues , amino acids , and vitamins . Patients following an **sVLPD** started **dialysis** therapy in the case of malnutrition , intractable fluid overload , hyperkalemia , or appearance of uremic symptoms . OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS Mortality , hospitalization , and metabolic markers . RESULTS 56 patients were randomly assigned to each group , median follow-up was 26.5 months ( interquartile range , 40 ) , and patients in the **diet** **group** spent a median of 10.7 months ( interquartile range , 11 ) following an **sVLPD** **.** Forty patients in the diet group started **dialysis** **treatment** because of either fluid overload or hyperkalemia . There were 31 deaths ( 55 % ) in the **dialysis** **group** and 28 deaths ( 50 % ) in the **diet** **group** **.** One-year observed survival rates at intention to treat were 83.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 74.5 to 94.0 ) in the **dialysis** group versus 87.3 % ( 95 % CI , 78.9 to 96.5 ) in the **diet** group ( log-rank test for noninferiority , P < 0.001 ; for superiority , P = 0.6 ) : the difference in survival was -3.6 % ( 95 % CI , -17 to +10 ; P = 0.002 ) . The hazard ratio for hospitalization was 1.50 for the **dialysis** **group** ( 95 % CI , 1.11 to 2.01 ; P < 0.01 ) . LIMITATIONS The unblinded nature of the study , exclusion of patients with diabetes , and incomplete enrollment . CONCLUSION An **sVLPD** was effective and safe when postponing dialysis treatment in elderly patients without diabetes .
