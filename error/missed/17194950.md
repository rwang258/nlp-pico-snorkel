**Music** **or** **guided** **imagery** for women undergoing colposcopy **:** a randomized controlled study of effects on anxiety , perceived pain , and patient satisfaction . OBJECTIVE It was hypothesized that **music** **or** **guided** **imagery** **versus** **usual** **care** would result in less anxiety and perceived pain for colposcopy patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were randomized to **music** **,** **guided** **imagery** **,** **or** **usual** **care** after completing a **baseline** **questionnaire** **.** All patients completed a **postprocedure** **questionnaire** **.** RESULTS Study participants ( N=170 ) had a mean age of 28.4 years ( SD=9.6 ; range 18-60 ) and formed a racially diverse group . Education/income levels were low . No between-group differences were found for postprocedure anxiety or pain rating . CONCLUSIONS **Mind-body** **interventions** had no statistically significant impact on reported anxiety , perceived pain , or satisfaction with care , even for those who anticipated the most pain or started with high anxiety .
