Examination of aggression and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorders and serious behavioral problems . This study identified subtypes of aggression in a sample of 206 children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) who participated in **2** risperidone **trials** **.** The narratives were derived from a parent interview about each child 's 2 most pressing problems . Five subtypes of aggression emerged : hot aggression only , cold aggression only , self-injurious behavior ( SIB ) only , aggression and SIB , and nonaggressive . All groups showed a high rate of positive response to risperidone with no differences across subtypes . These study findings extend understanding of aggression in ASD and may be useful to guide further study on biological mechanisms and individualized treatment in ASD .
