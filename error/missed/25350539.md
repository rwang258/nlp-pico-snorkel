Matching doses of distraction with child risk for distress during a medical procedure : a randomized clinical trial . BACKGROUND Parents often want to provide support to their children during medical procedures , but not all parents are effective in providing distraction after brief training . OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three doses **of** **distraction** intervention for children at high and medium risk for procedure-related distress . METHODS Children undergoing scheduled intravenous insertions for diagnostic or treatment purposes and their parents participated . A computerized application , Children , Parents and Distraction , was used to predict distress risk . Doses **of** intervention were basic **(** **parents** **trained** **on** **providing** **distraction** **)** , enhanced **(** **basic** **training** **plus** **tailored** **instructions** **,** **environmental** **modifications** **,** **and** **support** **and** **guidance** **from** **the** **research** assistant **)** , and professional **(** **a** **trained** **research** assistant **provided** **distraction** **)** . Outcome measures were Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised for behavioral distress , Oucher for self-reported pain , parent report of child distress , and salivary cortisol for physiological distress . RESULTS A total of 574 children , ages 4-10 , and their parents participated . The Children , Parents and Distraction predicted that the risk for distress was high for 156 children , medium for 372 , and low for 46 . Children predicted to have higher risk for distress displayed more behavioral distress ( p < .01 ) . Children in the medium-risk group who had the professional intervention displayed significantly less behavioral distress ( p < .001 ) . Children in the high-risk group tended to have less behavioral distress when receiving the professional intervention ( p = .07 ) . There were no significant group differences for self-report of pain , parent report of distress , or cortisol levels . DISCUSSION Some parents may need additional training in providing distraction to their children during procedures , and some children at medium and high risk for distress may need professional support . Parents should be asked about their preferences in acting as the distraction coach and , if willing , be provided as much training and support as possible in the clinical situation .
