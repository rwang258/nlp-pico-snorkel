Bovine carotid artery **heterografts** **versus** polytetrafluoroethylene **grafts** **.** A prospective , randomized study . A prospective , randomized comparison of **BCAH** **and** **PTFE** **vascular** **access** **grafts** resulted in no statistically significant difference when analyzed for survival rates of complications , types of complications , reasons for failure , and clot salvageability . The results in diabetic patients were similar to those in nondiabetic patients . The majority of retrospective studies and subjective experiences favor **PTFE** **grafts** over **BCAHs** . The explanation may be part that **BCAH** preceded **PTFE** **grafts** into clinical use , and inexperience in the operating room and in the dialysis unit had an effect on BCAH results . A review of impressions of the graft materials indicated a decided preference for **PTFE** **grafts** **.**
