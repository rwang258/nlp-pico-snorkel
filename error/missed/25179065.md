GPs ' experiences with **brief** intervention for medication-overuse headache : a qualitative study in general practice . BACKGROUND Medication-overuse headache ( MOH ) is common in the general population , and most patients are managed in primary health care . **Brief** Intervention **(** **BI** **)** has been used as a motivational technique for patients with drug and alcohol overuse , and may a have role in the treatment of MOH . AIM To explore **GPs** **'** **experiences** **using** **BI** **in** the management of patients with MOH . DESIGN AND SETTING Qualitative study in Norwegian general practice . METHOD Data were collected through four focus group interviews with 22 GPs who participated in an intervention study on **BI** for MOH . Systematic text condensation was used to analyse transcripts from the focus group interviews . RESULTS The **GPs** **experienced** challenges when trying to convince patients that the medication they used to treat and prevent headache could cause headache , but labelling MOH as a diagnosis opened up a space for change . GPs were able to use **BI** within the scope of a regular consultation , and they thought that the structured approach had a potential to change patients ' views about their condition and medication use . Being diagnosed with medication overuse could bring about feelings of guilt in patients , and GPs emphasised that a good alliance with the patient was necessary for successful change using BI to manage MOH . CONCLUSION **GPs** **experience** **BI** as a feasible strategy to treat MOH , and the technique relies on a good alliance between the doctor and patient . When using **BI** , GPs must be prepared to counter patients ' misconceptions about medication used for headache .
