The influence of preoperative **antibiotics** on success of **endosseous** **implants** up to and including stage II surgery : a study of 2,641 implants . According to the American College of Surgeons , complex oral surgical procedures , including the transoral placement of endosseous implants , are of the type that may require **prophylactic** **antibiotics** **.** However , the routine use of **prophylactic** **antibiotics** in the field of dental implantology continues to be controversial , and their utilization varies widely . No data from a randomized prospective clinical study of the prophylactic use of **antibiotics** in implant surgery have been previously published . As part of the comprehensive Dental Implant Clinical Research Group clinical implant study , the preoperative or postoperative use of **antibiotics** , the type used , and the duration of coverage was left to the discretion of the surgeon . These data were recorded and correlated with failure of osseointegration during healing ( stage I ) and at stage II surgery ( uncovering ) . The results showed that significantly fewer failures occurred when preoperative **antibiotics** were used .
