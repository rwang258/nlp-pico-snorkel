A randomised double-blind control study of early **intracoronary** autologous **bone** **marrow** **cell** infusion in acute myocardial infarction ( REGENERATE-AMI ) . INTRODUCTION Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide despite the latest therapeutic advances designed to decrease myocardial injury . Preclinical and emerging clinical evidence show that the intracoronary injection of autologous **bone** **marrow** **mononuclear** **cells** ( BMCs ) following AMI leads to improvement in left ventricular ejection function ( LVEF ) . In this clinical trial we will for the first time assess the effect of early ( < 24 h ) infusion of autologous BMCs following AMI on cardiac function . METHODS AND ANALYSIS REGENERATE-AMI is a double-blind , randomised , multicentre , placebo-controlled trial to determine whether early ( < 24 h ) intracoronary infusion of BMCs improves LVEF after AMI . The study will enrol 100 patients presenting with an anterior AMI demonstrating anterior regional wall motion abnormality . Patients will be randomised to receive **intracoronary** **infusion** **of** **BMCs** or **placebo** ( 0.9 % **saline** **)** . Primary endpoint will be change in LVEF at 1 year compared to baseline , measured by cardiac MRI . Secondary endpoints at 6 months include the change in global LVEF relative to baseline measured by quantitative left ventriculography and echocardiography , as well as major adverse cardiac events which is also measured at 1 year . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study will be performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and is approved by local ethics committee ( NRES Committee London West London : 07/Q0603/76 ) . TRIAL REGISTRATION http : //clincialtrials.gov ( NCT00765453 ) . The results of the trial will be published according to the CONSORT statement and will be presented at conferences and reported in peer-reviewed journals .
