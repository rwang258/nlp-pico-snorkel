Environmental enrichment as an effective treatment for autism : a randomized controlled trial . Enriched sensorimotor environments enable rodents to compensate for a wide range of neurological challenges , including those induced in animal models of autism . Given the sensorimotor deficits in most children with autism , we attempted to translate that approach to their treatment . In a randomized controlled trial , 3-12 year-old children with autism were assigned to either a **sensorimotor** **enrichment** **group** , which received daily **olfactory/tactile** stimulation **along** **with** **exercises** **that** stimulated **other** **paired** **sensory** **modalities** **,** **or** **to** **a** control **group** **.** We administered tests of cognitive performance and autism severity to both groups at the initiation of the study and after 6 months . Severity of autism , as assessed with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale , improved significantly in the enriched group compared to controls . Indeed , 42 % of the enriched group and only 7 % of the control group had what we considered to be a clinically significant improvement of 5 points on that scale . Sensorimotor enrichment also produced a clear improvement in cognition , as determined by their Leiter-R Visualization and Reasoning scores . At 6 months , the change in average scores for the enriched group was 11.3 points higher than that for the control group . Finally , 69 % of parents in the enriched group and 31 % of parents in the control group reported improvement in their child over the 6-month study . Environmental enrichment therefore appears to be effective in ameliorating some of the symptoms of autism in children .
