Rett syndrome : randomized controlled trial of **L-carnitine** **.** Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology , occurring almost exclusively in female patients . The etiology and functional significance of plasma carnitine deficiency seen in some patients with Rett syndrome is unknown . To investigate whether **L-carnitine** might be of benefit in Rett syndrome , a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind crossover trial of **L-carnitine** has been completed in 35 subjects . Eight-week treatment phases were completed for both a placebo **and** **L-carnitine** **.** Outcome was measured by parents/caregivers and at medical follow-up using three established tools : the Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment , the Hand Apraxia Scale , and the Patient Well-Being Index . Analysis comparing change between baseline and week 8 of treatment for **L-carnitine** and the **placebo** showed that both parents/caregivers and medical follow-up detected improvements in the subjects ' well-being . In addition , medical review showed an improvement on the Hand Apraxia Scale for a higher proportion of girls on L-carnitine . Identification of predictors of clinical improvement has been limited by the power of the study . These findings suggest that **L-carnitine** is of benefit in some patients with Rett syndrome . While **L-carnitine** did not lead to major functional changes in ability , the type of changes reported could still have a substantial impact on the girls and their families . Information is still needed , however , to determine if only subgroups of girls with the disorder are responsive to **L-carnitine** and the appropriate duration of therapy .
