**Aerobic** **and** strength **training** reduces adiposity in overweight Latina adolescents . PURPOSE To date , no study has examined the synergistic effects of a **nutrition** and combination **of** **aerobic** **and** strength **training** **(** **CAST** **)** on both adiposity and metabolic parameters in overweight Latina adolescent females . The goal was to assess if a 16-wk **nutrition** plus **CAST** pilot study had stronger effects on reducing adiposity and on improving glucose/insulin indices compared with control ( C ) , **nutrition** **only** ( N ) , and a **nutrition** plus strength **training** ( N + ST ) groups . METHODS In a 16-wk randomized trial , 41 overweight Latina girls ( 15.2 +/- 1.1 yr ) were randomly assigned to **C** ( n = 7 ) , **N** ( n = 10 ) , **N** **+** **ST** ( n = 9 ) , or **N** **+** **CAST** ( n = 15 ) . All intervention groups received modified **carbohydrate** **nutrition** **classes** ( once a week ) , whereas the **N** **+** **ST** also **received** strength **training** ( twice a week ) and the **N** **+** **CAST** received **a** combination **of** strength **and** **aerobic** **training** ( twice a week ) . The following were measured before and after intervention : strength by one repetition maximum , physical activity by the 7-d accelerometry and the 3-d physical activity recall , dietary intake by 3-d records , body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , glucose/insulin indices by oral glucose tolerance test , and intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal modeling . Across intervention group , effects were tested using ANCOVA with post hoc pairwise comparisons . RESULTS There were significant overall intervention effects for all adiposity measures ( weight , body mass index [ BMI ] , BMI z-scores , and DEXA total body fat ) , with a decrease of 3 % in the **N** **+** **CAST** group compared with a 3 % increase in the **N** **+** **ST** group ( P < or = 0.05 ) . There was also an intervention effect for fasting glucose with the **N** group increasing by 3 % and the **N** **+** **CAST** group decreasing by 4 % ( P < or = 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION The **CAST** was more effective than **nutrition** alone or **nutrition** plus **strength** **training** for reducing multiple adiposity outcomes and fasting glucose in overweight Latina girls . However , further research investigating and identifying intervention approaches that improve both adiposity and insulin indices , particularly in high-risk populations , are warranted .
