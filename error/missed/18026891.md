Comparison of long-term efficacy and safety of risperidone **and** haloperidol in children and adolescents with autistic disorder . An open label maintenance study . BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to investigate safety , efficacy and tolerability of risperidone in comparison with haloperidol in the long-term treatment of autistic disorder . METHODS This was an open-label continuation study of the randomized , double-blind , controlled trial of risperidone **and** haloperidol study for 12 week in autistic children and adolescents . A total of 28 subjects between 8 and 18 ages with autistic disorder were enrolled to the open label phase of the study . Behavioral rating scales ( Clinical Global Impression Scale [ CGI-I ] , Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale [ RF-RLRS ] ) , Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ ABC ] , Turgay DSM-IV Pervasive Developmental Disorder Rating Scale [ TPDDRS ] ) and safety assessment scales ( Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale [ ESRS ] , UKU-Side Effect Rating Scale ) were performed at 12 , 16 , 20 and 24 weeks , following the 12 week double-blind phase . Risperidone **and** haloperidol treatments were applied with a once daily dosage regimen as 0.01-0.08 mg/kg/day . RESULTS Risperidone led to a significant greater reduction on CGI scale . There was significant improvement on RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale and ABC scores in risperidone group . Weight gain was observed more frequently in the haloperidol group at week 24 . CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that risperidone is more efficacious and well tolerated than haloperidol in the long-term maintenance treatment of autistic disorder .
