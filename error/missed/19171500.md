A dose-ranging study of pramipexole for the symptomatic treatment of restless legs syndrome : polysomnographic evaluation of periodic leg movements and sleep disturbance . OBJECTIVE To evaluate , both polysomnographically and by subjective scales , the efficacy and safety profile of pramipexole for restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) via a 3-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , dose-ranging study . METHODS At baseline and after 3 weeks , periodic limb movements ( PLM ) and sleep parameters were assessed by **polysomnography** **,** **and** **patients** **self-assessed** **their** **sleep** **disturbance** **and** **overall** **RLS** **severity** **using** **the** **international** **RLS** **study** **group** rating **scale** **(** **IRLS** **)** . **Four** pramipexole doses **were** **evaluated** **:** **0.125** **,** **0.25** **,** **0.50** **,** **and** **0.75mg/d** **.** Data from 107 patients were included in the intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . RESULTS For pramipexole recipients , the primary outcome measure , PLM per hour in bed asleep or awake ( the PLM index , or PLMI ) , decreased by a median of -26.55 to -52.70 depending on dosage group , vs. -3.00 for placebo ( p < 0.01 or 0.001 for each group vs. placebo ; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test ) . Improvements in the secondary endpoints of PLM while asleep and while awake were also significantly superior for pramipexole . At 3 weeks , all **pramipexole** doses reduced the median for PLM while asleep to levels considered normal ( < 5PLM/h ) . Except for delta-sleep time and awakenings/arousals , sleep parameters remained unchanged or favored **pramipexole** **.** Median sleep latency was reduced by -5.00 to -11.75min in the pramipexole groups , vs. -2.00 for **placebo** ( p < 0.05 for all groups except 0.25mg/d ) . Median total sleep time increased by 25.75-66.75min , vs. 25.50 ( p < 0.05 for 0.50mg/d ) , and median time in stages 2-4/rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep increased by 37.00-68.00min , vs. 26.75 ( p < 0.05 for 0.50mg/d ) . By subjective IRLS ratings , all **pramipexole** doses were significantly superior to **placebo** **.** Safety analysis demonstrated no dose-dependent increase in adverse events , and no drug-related increase in daytime somnolence was observed . CONCLUSIONS **Pramipexole** is effective and well tolerated in RLS , most notably among objective measures , for reducing PLM and decreasing sleep latency . Although other sleep parameters showed lesser , usually insignificant change , patients ' subjective ratings of RLS severity and sleep disturbance were significantly improved ( p0.0023 ) .
