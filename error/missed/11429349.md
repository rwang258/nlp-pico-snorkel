The clinical and biochemical effects of propofol infusion **with** **and** **without** **EDTA** for maintenance anesthesia in healthy children undergoing ambulatory surgery . UNLABELLED We conducted this randomized , double-blinded , comparative , parallel-group study to determine whether adding **EDTA** **to** propofol would affect the clinical profile , calcium and magnesium homeostasis , or renal function in healthy children . After the **induction** **of** anesthesia **with** halothane , 69 ambulatory surgical patients ( 1 mo to < 17 yr old ) , **received** propofol **without** **EDTA** **(** **n** **=** **33** **)** **or** propofol **with** **EDTA** ( n = 36 ) . Blood samples were obtained for the measurement of ionized calcium , ionized magnesium , and laboratory indicators of renal function . Hemodynamic measurements , recovery , and adverse events were recorded . Propofol **with** **EDTA** produced no significant effects on clinical efficacy or renal function . Propofol **and** propofol **EDTA** produced a statistically significant decrease from baseline in serum concentrations of ionized calcium and magnesium during infusion ( P < 0.05 ) , but with no apparent clinical effect . Hemodynamic measurements generally remained stable and were similar for both groups . Statistically significant changes in systolic blood pressure , mean arterial pressure , and heart rate were not considered clinically significant . Adverse events were mild or moderate . The addition of **EDTA** does not alter the clinical profile of propofol in pediatric ambulatory surgical patients . With or without **EDTA** **,** **propofol** is associated with a decrease in ionized calcium with no apparent clinical effect . IMPLICATIONS The addition of EDTA does not alter the clinical profile of propofol in pediatric ambulatory surgical patients . With or without EDTA , propofol is associated with a decrease in ionized calcium with no apparent clinical effect .
