Acute effects of different **stretching** **durations** on passive torque , mobility , and isometric muscle force . Static **stretching** is widely applied in various disciplines . However , the acute effects of different durations of **stretching** are unclear . Therefore , this study was designed to investigate the acute effects of **different** **stretching** **durations** on muscle function and flexibility , and provide an insight into the optimal duration of static **stretching** **.** This randomized crossover trial included 24 healthy students ( 17 men and 7 women ) who **stretched** their right hamstrings for durations of 20 , 60 , 180 , and 300 seconds in a random order . The following outcomes were assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer as markers of lower-limb function and flexibility : static passive torque ( SPT ) , dynamic passive torque ( DPT ) , stiffness , straight leg raise ( SLR ) , and isometric muscle force . Static passive torque was significantly decreased after all **stretching** durations ( p < 0.05 ) . Static passive torque was significantly lower after 60 , 180 , and 300 seconds of **stretching** compared with that after **20-second** **stretching** , and stiffness decreased significantly after **180-** **and** **300-second** **stretching** ( p < 0.05 ) . In addition , DPT and stiffness were significantly lower after 300 seconds than after **20-second** **stretching** ( p < 0.05 ) , and SLR increased significantly after all **stretching** durations ( p < 0.05 ) . Straight leg raise was higher after 180- and **300-second** **stretching** than after **20-second** **stretching** and higher after **300-second** **stretching** than after **60-second** **stretching** ( p < 0.05 ) . Isometric muscle force significantly decreased after all **stretching** **durations** ( p < 0.05 ) . Therefore , increased duration of **stretching** is associated with a decrease in SPT but an increase in SLR . Over **180** **seconds** **of** **stretching** was required to decrease DPT and stiffness , but isometric muscle force decreased regardless of the **stretching** **duration** **.** In conclusion , these results indicate that longer durations of **stretching** are needed to provide better flexibility .
