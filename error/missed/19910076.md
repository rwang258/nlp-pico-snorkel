**First-line** cisplatin **with** docetaxel **or** vinorelbine in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer : a quality of life directed phase II randomized trial of Gruppo Oncologico Italia Meridionale . BACKGROUND Quality of life ( QoL ) has gained greater importance in the management of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer due to the palliative nature of treatment . Docetaxel **(** **DCT** **)** **and** cisplatin **(** **CDDP** **)** **doublet** has been reported to be associated to a better QoL than the weekly vinorelbine **(** **VNR** **)** **and** **CDDP** regimen . Recently a newer more tolerated schedule of the **VNR/CDDP** regimen has been published and is widely employed in medical practice . The impact of these regimens on patients ' QoL as well as symptoms control and type and grading chemo-related side-effects has been compared prospectically . METHODS Patients received **CDDP** **75** **mg/m** **(** **2** **)** **plus** **DCT** **75** **mg/m** **(** **2** **)** on day 1 every weeks ( arm A ) or **CDDP** **80** **mg/m** **(** **2** **)** **on** **day** **1** **plus** **VNR** **30** **mg/m** **(** **2** **)** day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks ( arm B ) . **G-CSF** **and/or** **EPO** were employed as needed . Health-related QoL was assessed at entry and after every cycle by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires , toxicity by the NCI-NCCN CTC vs 2 , and intent-to-treat objective response by the Recist criteria . RESULTS The QoL questionnaires were completed by 37 pts ( 88 % ) in the **DCT/CDDP** arm and 39 pts ( 87 % ) in the **VNR/CDDP** one . Baseline mean scores and rates at which pts failed to complete QoL assessment were similar in the two arms . Global health status of the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale and specific symptoms control ( LC13 module ) improved during treatment without any statistically significant difference between the two arms . Emotional functioning remained stable in both groups during treatment , whereas physical and role improved slightly . In the **DCT/CDDP** arm 14 pts ( 33 % ; 95 % CL 24-40 % ) had PR , and 10 ( 24 % ) SD for a 57 % TGCR . In the **VNR/CDDP** arm 12 pts ( 27 % ) achieved PR , 18 ( 41 % ) SD a 68 % TGCR . Differences were not statistically significant . Median time-to-progression was 4.2 months in the **DCT/CDDP** arm and 4.5 months in the **VNR/CDDP** one , and median overall survival was 12.1 ( range 1-26+ months ) and 12.5 months ( range 1-28+ months ) for **DCT/CDDP** and **VNR/CDDP** arms , respectively . Febrile neutropenia rate was higher in the **VNR/CDDP** arm ( p=0.02 ) as well as G3-4 anemia ( p=0.005 ) and G-CSF/EPO use ( p=0.019 ) . CONCLUSIONS Global and specific health-related QoL data similar in both treatment groups with no statistically significant difference . Efficacy measures , overall response rate , time-to-progression and overall survival were equivalent in both arms . However , severe anemia and febrile neutropenia are statistically more frequent in the **VNR/CDDP** arm than in the **DCT/CDDP** one . These data should be considered in treatment decision-making for pts with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and for the design of future trials with chemotherapy plus biologics .
