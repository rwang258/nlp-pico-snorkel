Study protocol : Phase III single-blinded fast-track pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention for breathlessness in advanced disease . BACKGROUND Breathlessness in advanced disease causes significant distress to patients and carers and presents management challenges to health care professionals . The **Breathlessness** Intervention Service **(** **BIS** **)** seeks to improve the care of breathless patients with advanced disease ( regardless of cause ) through the use of evidence-based practice and working with other healthcare providers . **BIS** delivers **a** complex intervention **(** **of** **non-pharmacological** **and** **pharmacological** treatments **)** via a multi-professional team . **BIS** is being continuously developed and its impact evaluated using the MRC 's framework for complex interventions ( PreClinical , Phase I and Phase II completed ) . This paper presents the protocol for Phase III . METHODS/DESIGN Phase III comprises a pragmatic , fast-track , single-blind randomised controlled trial of **BIS** versus standard **care** **.** Due to differing disease trajectories , the service uses **two** **broad** service **models** **:** one for patients with malignant disease ( intervention delivered over two weeks ) and one for patients with non-malignant disease ( intervention delivered over four weeks ) . The Phase III trial therefore consists of two sub-protocols : one for patients with malignant conditions ( four week protocol ) and one for patients with non-malignant conditions ( eight week protocol ) . **Mixed** **method** **interviews** are conducted with patients and their lay carers at three to five measurement points depending on randomisation and sub-protocol . Qualitative interviews are conducted with referring and non-referring health care professionals ( malignant disease protocol only ) . The primary outcome measure is 'patient distress due to breathlessness ' measured on a numerical rating scale ( 0-10 ) . The trial includes economic evaluation . Analysis will be on an intention to treat basis . DISCUSSION This is the first evaluation of a breathlessness intervention for advanced disease to have followed the MRC framework and one of the first palliative care trials to use fast track methodology and single-blinding . The results will provide evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the service , informing its longer term development and implementation of the model in other centres nationally and internationally . It adds to methodological developments in **palliative** **care** research where complex interventions are common but evidence sparse .
