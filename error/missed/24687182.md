A randomized controlled trial of an **inference** **generation** **strategy** intervention for adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder . PURPOSE The present intervention study investigated the efficacy of the **ACT** **&** **Check** **Strategy** intervention to improve inference generation when reading , metacognitive ability , general reading comprehension , and social inference ability in adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder ( HF-ASD ) . METHOD Twenty-five adults with HF-ASD were randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control **group** **.** Treatment sessions were conducted in 1-hr sessions , twice a week , for a total of 6 weeks . Treatment focused on **explicit** **instruction** **of** **components** **of** **inference** **generation** **,** **categories** **of** **inferences** **,** **and** **increasingly** **independent** **strategy** **use** **.** RESULTS The treatment group demonstrated significantly superior performance on 1 of 2 measures of inference generation in reading and 1 measure of metacognitive ability compared with the control group . Significant differences between groups were not found on measures of reading comprehension or social inference ability . CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the **ACT** **&** **Check** **Strategy** was effective in improving participants ' ability to generate inferences in reading and certain metacognitive abilities , but the skills do not appear to generalize to other social communication contexts , such as social inference generation . This research provides a measure of support for explicitly teaching inference generation to address a reading inference deficit in adults with HF-ASD .
