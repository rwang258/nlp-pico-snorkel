Treatment of bladder cancer with intravesical instillation of adriamycin **.** Intravesical treatment with adriamycin has been extensively employed in the last decade . In the treatment of carcinoma in situ complete responses have been reported in about 60 % of cases . Its efficacy is probably lower in the therapy of multiple or diffuse low stage transitional cell carcinoma that is too extensive to be completely resected by conventional transurethral surgery . In such circumstances , including cancer in situ , adriamycin compares favorably with other local forms of treatment . The prophylactic use of intravesical instillation of Adriamycin has been studied more extensively . Preliminary results of controlled randomized trials implemented from the EORTC Urological Group show that adriamycin instillations significantly reduce recurrence rate after TUR . The treatment is well tolerated . Systemic absorption is virtually absent , and no severe drug-related side effects have ever been reported . Chemical cystitis is occasionally observed , especially if multiple instillations are started immediately after TUR , or in the presence of additional inflammatory conditions , such as previous irradiation or bacterial cystitis .
