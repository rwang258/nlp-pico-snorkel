Effects of **dietary** **pyridoxine** on haemato-immunological responses of Labeo rohita fingerlings reared at higher water temperature . A sixty-day feeding trial was carried out to elucidate the effect of **dietary** **pyridoxine** **(** **PN** **)** on hemato-immunological parameters in Labeo rohita fingerlings exposed to an elevated temperature ( ET ) of 33 °C . Two hundred and seventy fingerlings ( 6.71 ± 0.32 g ) were randomly distributed **into** **six** **treatments** **in** **triplicates** ( 15 fish/tank ) . **Five** **iso-nitrogenous** **(** **356.3** **±** **2.7** **g/kg** **crude** **protein** **)** **purified** **diets** were prepared with graded levels ( 0 , 10 , 50 , 100 and 200 mg/kg diet ) of PN . Six treatment groups were P10T26 ( 10 mg PN + ambient temperature ( 26 °C ) , P0T33 ( 0 mg PN + ET ) , P10T33 ( 10 mg PN + ET ) , P50T33 ( 50 mg PN + ET ) , P100T33 ( 100 mg PN + ET ) and P200T33 ( 200 mg PN + ET ) . The responses of L. rohita fingerlings to dietary PN were assessed in terms of growth and by analysing some hemato-immunological parameters . **When** **PN** **supplementation** increased from 10 to 200 mg/kg diet , a significant improvement in weight gain percentage was observed . Erythrocyte ( RBC ) count , leucocyte ( WBC ) count , haemoglobin content and respiratory burst activity were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher in **100** **mg** **PN/kg** **diet-fed** group than **their** **non-PN-fed** counterpart . Also , serum albumin , globulin and lysozyme activity were found significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher in PN-fed groups . The overall results indicated **that** **dietary** **PN** **supplementation** at 100 mg/kg diet may reverse the negative effects caused by ET and may protect the haemato-immunological status of L. rohita fingerlings reared at higher water temperature .
