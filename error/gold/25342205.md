**Dexmedetomidine** pretreatment alleviates propofol injection pain . OBJECTIVE The incidence of **propofol** injection pain during induction of general anesthesia varies from 28 % to 90 % . This prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluated the effect of **dexmedetomidine** **(** **DEX** **)** for reducing the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain . METHODS Patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated into seven groups of 30 patients each . Experimental treatments were intravenously administered over 10 min ( total volume 10 mL ) prior to intravenous **propofol** injection , as follows : group I , the control group , was given **isotonic** **saline** **.** Patients in groups II , III , and IV received **DEX** **0.25** **µg/kg** **,** **0.5** **µg/kg** **,** **or** **1.0** **µg/kg** **,** **respectively** **,** **mixed** **with** **isotonic** **saline** **immediately** **before** **propofol** **injection** . Patients in groups V , VI , and VII **received** **DEX** **as** **above** **,** **but** **5** **minutes** **before** **propofol** **injection** **.** **Propofol** **consisted** **of** **1** **%** **long-chain** **triglyceride** **propofol** **(** **2.5** **mg/kg** **)** **injected** **at** **1** **mL/s** . RESULTS Median propofol injection pain score was 0.00 ( IQR 0.00-3.00 ) in patients who received 1.0 µg/kg DEX 5 min before the propofol injection ( group VII ) , and only 1 patient ( of 30 ) in this group received a pain score > 2 . The median pain score and number of patients with pain scores > 2 in group VII were both significantly less than in the control ( group I ; p = 0.000 , both ) . There were no differences in either mean arterial pressure or heart rate at any time point **after** DEX injection among the groups . CONCLUSIONS Pretreatment with **intravenous** DEX 1 µg/kg 5 min prior to injection of long-chain triglyceride propofol is effective and safe in reducing the incidence and severity of pain due to propofol injection .
