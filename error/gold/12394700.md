**Transurethral** **prostate** **resection** and bleeding : a randomized , **placebo** controlled trial of role of **finasteride** for decreasing operative blood loss . PURPOSE Bleeding associated with transurethral prostate resection can often be significant and lead to increased morbidity and occasionally mortality . It has been shown that **finasteride** decreases bleeding in patients with hematuria of prostatic origin . We hypothesized that bleeding in patients undergoing transurethral prostate resection could be decreased by giving **finasteride** for 2 weeks before surgery . MATERIALS AND METHODS A total 70 patients scheduled to undergo elective transurethral prostate resection were randomized to receive **5** **mg.** **finasteride** **daily** **or** **placebo** for 2 weeks before surgery . Serum hemoglobin was measured before and after surgery , and the following day . The volume of irrigation fluid used and its hemoglobin concentration as well as resected prostate weight were recorded . RESULTS Of the 68 patients who underwent transurethral prostate resection 2 were withdrawn before surgery , and so 32 received **finasteride** and 36 received **placebo** **.** There was significantly less mean blood loss in irrigation fluid in the **finasteride** group than in the control group ( 43.6 versus 69.3 gm . hemoglobin , p = 0.011 ) . The mean difference was more significant when blood loss per gm . resected prostate was calculated ( 2.65 versus 4.65 gm . hemoglobin per gm . prostate , p < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS This study shows that **finasteride** given for 2 weeks preoperatively decreases bleeding in patients undergoing transurethral prostate resection . Further study is required to determine the optimal timing and dose duration to minimize blood loss and identify how relevant such a decrease in bleeding is in clinical practice .
