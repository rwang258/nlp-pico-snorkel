**Low** **protein** **provision** during the first year of life , but not during foetal life , affects metabolic traits , organ mass development and growth in male mink ( Neovison vison ) . **Low** **protein** provision in utero and post-partum may induce metabolic disorders in adulthood . Studies in mink have mainly focused on short-term consequences of **low** **protein** **provision** in utero whereas the long-term responses to **low** **protein** **(** **LP** **)** **provision** in metabolically programmed mink are unknown . We investigated whether low protein provision in utero affects the long-term response to adequate ( AP ) or LP provision after weaning in male mink . Eighty-six male mink were exposed to low ( 19 % of ME from CP ; **crude** **protein** **)** or **adequate** **(** **31** **%** **of** **ME** **from** **CP** **)** **protein** provision in utero , and to LP ( ~20 % of ME from CP ) or AP ( 30-42 % of ME from CP ) provision post-weaning . Being metabolically programmed by **low** **protein** provision in utero did not affect the response to post-weaning diets . Dietary protein content in the LP feed after weaning was below requirements ; evidenced by lower nitrogen retention ( p < 0.001 ) preventing LP mink from attaining their growth potential ( p < 0.02 ) . LP mink had a lower liver , pancreas and kidney weight ( p < 0.05 ) as well as lower plasma IGF-1 concentrations at 8 and 25 ( p < 0.05 ) weeks , and a higher incidence of hepatic lipidosis at 25 weeks ( p < 0.05 ) . Furthermore , LP mink had a higher body fat ( p < 0.05 ) and lower body CP content ( p < 0.05 ) at 50 weeks of age . It is concluded that some effects of **low** **protein** **provision** **in** utero can be alleviated by an adequate nutrient supply post-partum . However , long-term exposure to **low** **protein** **provision** in mink reduces their growth potential and induces transient hepatic lipidosis and modified body composition .
