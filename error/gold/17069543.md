A double-blind **placebo-controlled** pilot study of **olanzapine** in childhood/adolescent pervasive developmental disorder . Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to improve disruptive and repetitive behaviors in pervasive developmental disorders ( PDDs ) , but they require assessment of potential side effects . This is the first **placebo-controlled** trial of **olanzapine** in the treatment of children and adolescents with PDD . Eleven patients with a diagnosis of either autism , Asperger 's syndrome , or PDD not otherwise specified ( PDD-NOS ) and aged 6-14 years were randomized into an 8-week double-blind , **placebo-controlled** , parallel treatment study with **olanzapine** **.** There was a significant linear trend x group interaction on the Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement ( CGI-I ) and 50 % on olanzapine versus 20 % on placebo were responders . Olanzapine was associated with significant weight gain ( 7.5 +/- 4.8 lbs vs. 1.5 +/- 1.5 lbs on placebo ) . Olanzapine may be a promising treatment for improving global functioning of PDDs , but the risk of significant weight gain remains a concern . Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of children with PDD .
