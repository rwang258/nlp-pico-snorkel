The effect of the **PostureJac** on deep cervical flexor endurance : implications in the management of cervicogenic headache and mechanical neck pain . The convergence of cervical and trigeminal afferents on second-order neurons in the trigeminocervical nucleus may refer pain from the upper cervical spine into the head and face . Furthermore , " bi-directional interactions " between trigeminal and upper cervical afferents may also explain neck symptoms of trigeminal origin ( e.g. , migraine ) . It is known that cervicogenic headache sufferers present with several musculoskeletal changes including poor endurance of the deep cervical flexor muscles . These intrinsic muscles of the neck contribute to stabilization and protection of the cervical spine and are critical for the control of both intervertebral motion and the cervical lordosis . The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of the **PostureJac** ( SomatoCentric Systems , Inc. , Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) , a posture support and exercise jacket , was effective in enhancing deep cervical muscle endurance . Forty-five ( 45 ) female subjects , between the ages of 18 and 40 years , were randomly assigned to three groups consisting of the **no-treatment** **control** , the **treatment-control** **(** **table** **stabilization** **)** **,** **and** **the** **experimental** **(** **PostureJac** **)** **group** **.** The outcome measure of deep cervical flexor muscle endurance was based on the Flexor Endurance Test and was recorded in seconds . The results indicated that the **PostureJac** group was superior to the no-treatment control ( p=.001 ) and the treatment-control ( p=.004 ) groups in terms of increasing endurance of the deep cervical flexors . Consequently , the **PostureJac** may be a useful therapeutic tool in the management of cervicogenic headache and mechanical neck pain .
