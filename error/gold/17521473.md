Pilot comparison between **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** **and** **bipolar** **radiofrequency** in paediatric tonsillectomy . OBJECTIVES To compare the advantages and disadvantages of **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** **with** **those** **of** **bipolar** **radiofrequency** **techniques** , in paediatric tonsillectomy . STUDY DESIGN Prospective , randomised , clinical study . PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 2004 to April 2006 , 80 patients aged between 10 and 15 years , with **tonsillectomy** planned for chronic tonsillitis , were included in the study . Children were prospectively randomised into two equal groups : **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** **tonsillectomy** **and** **bipolar** **radiofrequency** **tonsillectomy** **.** Operative time and intra-operative blood loss were recorded . Patients were scheduled for follow up during the first , second and fourth post-operative weeks . They were asked to record their pain and discomfort on a standardised visual analogue scale , from zero ( no pain ) to 10 ( severe pain ) . Post-operative complications were also recorded and managed . RESULTS The **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** **group** showed a slightly longer operative time ( mean 12 minutes ) than the bipolar radiofrequency group ( mean 10 minutes ) . Intra-operative blood loss was significantly less in the **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** group ( mean 21 cm3 ) than in the **bipolar** **radiofrequency** **group** ( mean 30 cm3 ) . In the first week , post-operative pain scores were less in the **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** group than in the bipolar radiofrequency group ( means 7.5 and 8.5 , respectively ) . However , in the second week pain scores increased more in the potassium titanyl phosphate laser group than in the bipolar radiofrequency group ( means 8.5 and 6 , respectively ) . In the fourth week , both groups showed equal and nearly normal pain scores . No case of reactionary post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage was recorded in either group . Only one case of secondary post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage was recorded , in the potassium titanyl phosphate laser group ( 2.5 per cent ) , managed conservatively . CONCLUSION Both the **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **and** **the** **bipolar** **radiofrequency** **techniques** were safe and easy to use for tonsillectomy , with reduced operative time , blood loss and complication rates and better post-operative general patient condition . **Potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** resulted in reduced operative bleeding and immediate post-operative pain , compared with the bipolar radiofrequency technique . However , **potassium** **titanyl** **phosphate** **laser** required slightly more operative time and caused more late post-operative pain than the bipolar radiofrequency technique . The low rate of recorded complications showed that both techniques cause little damage to the tonsillar bed during dissection , thus minimising complications .
