A randomized double blind **placebo** controlled clinical trial of **N-Acetylcysteine** **added** **to** **risperidone** for treating autistic disorders . BACKGROUND This study examined the efficacy and safety of **N-acetylcysteine** **(** **NAC** **)** augmentation for treating irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) . METHOD Forty children and adolescents met diagnostic criteria for ASD according to DSM-IV . They were randomly allocated into one of the two groups of **NAC** **(** **1200** **mg/day** **)** **+risperidone** **or** **placebo+risperidone** **.** **NAC** **and** **placebo** were administered in the form of effervescent and in two divided doses for 8 weeks . Irritability subscale score of Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) was considered as the main outcome measure . Adverse effects were also checked . RESULTS The mean score of irritability in **the** **NAC+risperidone** **and** **placebo+risperidone** groups at baseline was 13.2 ( 5.3 ) and 16.7 ( 7.8 ) , respectively . The scores after 8 weeks were 9.7 ( 4.1 ) and 15.1 ( 7.8 ) , respectively . Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups after 8 weeks . The most common adverse effects in **the** **NAC+risperidone** group were constipation ( 16.1 % ) , increased appetite ( 16.1 % ) , fatigue ( 12.9 % ) , nervousness ( 12.9 % ) , and daytime drowsiness ( 12.9 % ) . There was no fatal adverse effect . **CONCLUSIONS** **Risperidone** **plus** **NAC** more than risperidone plus placebo decreased irritability in children and adolescents with ASD . Meanwhile , it did not change the core symptoms of autism . Adverse effects were not common **and** **NAC** was generally tolerated well .
