Immune status of infants fed **soy-based** **formulas** with or without **added** **nucleotides** for 1 year : part 2 : immune cell populations . BACKGROUND Infants fed a **soy** **protein** **isolate-based** **formula** have immunization responses similar to breast-fed infants . However , cellular aspects of the immunologic development of soy-fed infants have not been studied extensively . **Nucleotides** added to milk-based formula benefit infant immune status , but reports of the immunologic effects of adding **nucleotides** to **soy-based** **formula** are not available . This study examines immune cell populations of infants fed **soy** **protein** **isolate** **formulas** with and without added **nucleotides** for 1 year . METHODS Newborn , term infants studied in a masked 12-month feeding trial were **assigned** **randomly** **to** **soy** **formula** **groups** **with** **and** **without** **added** **nucleotides** **(** **n** **=** **94** **,** **n** **=** **92** **)** **.** A nonrandomized **human** **milk/formula-fed** **cohort** **(** **n** **=** **81** **)** **,** **was** concurrently enrolled . **Blood** **samples** **were** **collected** **at** **6** **,** **7** **,** **and** **12** **months** **.** Thirty-two immune cell populations were characterized using three-color flow cytometry . Cellular markers were chosen to assess general pediatric immune status , emphasizing maturation and activation of B , T , and NK lymphocytes . RESULTS All cell populations , number and percentages , were within age-related normal ranges . The only significant difference found between **soy** **formula** and **human** **milk/formula-fed** infants was the percentage of CD57 + NK T cells at 12 months ( human milk/formula > soy formula , P = 0.034 ) . There were significant differences at some time points between human milk/formula-fed and **nucleotide-supplemented** soy formula-fed infants in populations of lymphocytes , eosinophils , total T , helper T , naive helper , memory/effector helper , CD57 - T , and CD11b + CD8 + NK cells . None of the cell populations differed between infants fed soy formula versus soy plus **nucleotides** **.** CONCLUSIONS Infants fed this commercial soy formula demonstrated immune cell status similar to human milk/formula-fed infants , consistent with normal immune system development . The addition of **nucleotides** to soy formula did not significantly change specific individual immune cell populations but tended to increase numbers and percentages of T cells and decreased numbers and percentages of NK cells .
