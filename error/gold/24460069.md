A randomized pilot study with **daily** **walking** during adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast and colorectal cancer . BACKGROUND **Physical** **activity** during chemotherapy has been shown in several studies to reduce fatigue , improve symptoms and impact positively on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) . Challenges associated with intervention studies on **physical** **activity** during cancer treatment relate to consistent adherence . The primary objective was to study feasibility and adherence of **physical** **activity** **intervention** among patients with cancer during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment . The secondary objective was to investigate the effects of **physical** **activity** on health aspects , including HRQoL , symptoms and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease . MATERIAL AND METHODS This randomized controlled trial included patients with breast cancer ( BRCA ) and colorectal cancer ( CRC ) during **adjuvant** **chemotherapy** **.** **The** **intervention** **continued** **for** **10** **weeks** **and** **included** **daily** **walks** **of** **10** **000** **steps** **and** **a** **weekly** **supervised** **group** **walk** **.** **Adherence** **was** **assessed** **by** **a** **pedometer** **and** **the** **number** **of** **participants** **who** **reported** **step** **counts** **every** **week** **and** **percentage** **of** **participants** **who** **achieved** **the** **target** **steps** **every** **week** **.** RESULTS Adherence average reached 91 % during the intervention period ; in total 74 % completed the **exercise** intervention . The majority of the participants achieved an average of 83 % of the target of 10 000 steps per day for 10 weeks . There was a significant increase in **daily** **physical** **activity** ( p = 0.016 ) in the intervention group . Significant differences were also found for some breast cancer-specific symptoms [ swelling , mobility and pain ( p = 0.045 ) ] . The study showed a relatively small weight gain an average of 0.9 kg in the intervention group and 1.3 kg in the **control** **group** **.** CONCLUSION **Physical** **activity** **in** **the** **form** **of** **walking** is feasible during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment despite increasing symptoms . The **physical** **activity** increased in the intervention group during the study time and had a positive impact on breast symptoms and the weight gain was lower in comparison to previous studies .
