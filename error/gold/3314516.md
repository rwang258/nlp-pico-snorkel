Effects of **maternal** **glucose** **infusion** on fetal acid-base status in human pregnancy . The maternal and fetal metabolic effects of three commonly used intravenous fluids administered before regional anesthesia were studied in 32 gravid women undergoing elective cesarean section at term . Patients were randomized into one of three groups to receive 1 L of either **5** **%** **dextrose** ( 50 gm of **glucose** **)** **or** **Ringer** **'s** **lactate** **or** **isotonic** **saline** **solution** before **epidural** **anesthesia** **.** Acute glucose infusion resulted in maternal hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , and an increase in the blood lactate level . Cord blood glucose , insulin , and lactate levels were also increased in this group . The key finding of this study was the significant lowering of pH in the umbilical cord vein ( 7.31 +/- 0.04 ) and artery ( 7.21 +/- 0.06 ) in the glucose-infused group when compared with the non-glucose infusion groups ( p less than 0.05 ) . Confounding perinatal factors such as maternal position , maternal hypotension , and prolonged time of surgery did not influence the fetal acid-base status . Thus acute maternal glucose infusion in normal patients can cause fetal hyperglycemia , metabolic acidosis , and neonatal hypoglycemia . These findings may be of particular clinical importance when fetal distress or fetal hypoxemia is due to other perinatal events . Under these circumstances , acute maternal glucose infusion may further contribute to fetal metabolic acidosis .
