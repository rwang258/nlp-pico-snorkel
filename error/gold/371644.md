Management of unstable angina at rest by **verapamil** **.** A double-blind cross-over study in coronary care unit . A therapeutic trial with **verapamil** , a **calcium-antagonist** **drug** , was performed in 12 patients admitted to our coronary care unit because of frequent daily attacks of angina at rest attributed to coronary vasospasm . After a 48-hour run-in period , **oral** **verapamil** **480** **mg/day** **and** **placebo** were administered alternately during 4 randomised 48-hour periods . Transient ischaemic attacks with ST segment elevation or depression , with or without pain , were documented by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring . The number of attacks during the run-in and 2 **placebo** periods were 128 , 123 , and 130 , respectively , and 31 and 23 during the 2 treatment periods ( P less than 0.006 and P less than 0.003 ) . This drug therefore appears to be effective in the management of patients with frequent attacks of angina at rest .
