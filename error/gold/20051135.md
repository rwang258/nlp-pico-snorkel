Improved adherence with once-daily versus twice-daily dosing of **mometasone** **furoate** administered via a dry powder inhaler : a randomized open-label study . BACKGROUND Poor adherence with prescribed asthma medication is a major barrier to positive treatment outcomes . This study was designed to determine the effect of a once-daily administration of **mometasone** **furoate** administered via a dry powder inhaler ( MF-DPI ) on treatment adherence compared with a twice-daily administration . METHODS This was a 12-week open-label study designed to mimic an actual clinical setting in patients > or=12 years old with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma . Patients were randomized to receive **MF-DPI** **400** **microg** **once-daily** **in** **the** **evening** **or** **MF-DPI** **200** **microg** **twice-daily** **.** Adherence was assessed primarily using the number of actual administered doses reported from the device counter divided by the number of scheduled doses . Self-reports were also used to determine adherence . Health-related quality of life , healthcare resource utilization , and days missed from work or school were also reported . RESULTS 1233 patients were randomized . The mean adherence rates , as measured by the automatic dose counter , were significantly better ( P < 0.001 ) with MF-DPI 400 microg once-daily in the evening ( 93.3 % ) than with MF-DPI 200 microg twice-daily ( 89.5 % ) . Mean adherence rates based on self-reports were also significantly better ( P < 0.001 ) with MF-DPI 400 microg QD PM ( 97.2 % ) than with MF-DPI 200 microg twice-daily ( 95.3 % ) . Adherence rates were lower in adolescents ( 12-17 years old ) . Health-related quality of life improved by 20 % in patients using MF-DPI once-daily in the evening and by 14 % in patients using MF-DPI twice-daily . Very few ( < 8 % ) patients missed work/school . CONCLUSION Mean adherence rates were greater with a once-daily dosing regimen of **MF-DPI** than with a twice-daily dosing regimen.This trial was completed prior to the ISMJE requirements for trial registration .
