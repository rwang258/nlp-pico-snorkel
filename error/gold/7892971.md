Peritonsillar infiltration with **bupivacaine** for paediatric tonsillectomy . In a double-blind study forty-two children scheduled for elective adenotonsillectomy were randomized to receive peritonsillar **infiltration** , following induction of anaesthesia , with either **0.25** **%** **plain** **bupivacaine** **or** **0.9** **%** **saline** , 0.5 ml/kg to a maximum of 10 ml . The children were assessed on awakening , and then 10 minutes , 1 hour , 4 hours and 24 hours later . On each occasion the observer gave the child a pain score from 1 ( no pain ) to 5 ( severe pain ) . The scores on awakening and after 10 minutes were significantly lower in the **bupivacaine** group ( P < 0.05 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . Thereafter there was no difference between the groups . The authors conclude that peritonsillar infiltration with **bupivacaine** is only moderately useful as analgesia for children having tonsillectomy .
