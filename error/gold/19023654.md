**Stepping** **Stones** **Triple** **P** **:** an RCT of a **parenting** **program** with parents of a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder . Whilst the **Triple** **P** **Positive** **Parenting** **Program** has a large evidence base ( Sanders , Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review 2:71-90 , 1999 ; Sanders , Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 68:624-640 , 2000 ) and preliminary evidence indicates that **Stepping** **Stones** **Triple** **P** is also efficacious ( Roberts , Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology , 35 ( 2 ) :180-193 , 2006 ) , to date **Stepping** **Stones** has not been evaluated with the ASD population . Fifty-nine families with a child with ASD aged between 2 and 9 participated in this randomized controlled trial . The results demonstrate significant improvements in parental reports of child behaviour and parenting styles with the treatment effects for child behaviour , parental over reactivity and parental verbosity being maintained at follow-up 6 months later . Further , the results suggest significant improvements in parental satisfaction and conflict about parenting as well as a sleeper effect for parental efficacy . The results indicate that **Stepping** **Stones** **Triple** **P** is a promising intervention for parents of children with ASD . Limitations and future research are also addressed .
