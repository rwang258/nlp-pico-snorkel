Functional outcome following **intramedullary** **nailing** **of** **the** **femur** **:** a prospective randomized comparison of piriformis fossa and greater trochanteric entry portals . BACKGROUND The purpose of the study was to prospectively compare the functional outcome of **intramedullary** **nailing** **of** **the** **femur** performed with use of a trochanteric and a piriformis fossa entry portal . METHODS One hundred and ten patients with a femoral shaft fracture were enrolled in a prospective , randomized study . Fifty-four patients were randomized to Group A **(** **piriformis** **fossa** **portal** **)** and fifty-six to Group B **(** **trochanteric** **portal** **)** . Outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities ( WOMAC ) Osteoarthritis Index hip function score , pain , and blinded functional evaluation by a physical therapist . RESULTS Most measures of hip function did not differ between the two groups . The WOMAC score at three , six , and twelve months did not differ significantly between the piriformis fossa and trochanteric nailing groups . Functional tests included the chair stand test and the timed up and go test . Patients in Group B had significantly better scores on the chair stand test ( 13.3 compared with 11.1 in Group A , p = 0.04 ) at six months postoperatively , but there was no difference at twelve months ( 14.0 compared with 13.6 ) . The two groups did not differ significantly on the timed up and go test at either six or twelve months . The two groups also did not differ on the muscle strength testing . Intraoperative parameters differed significantly between the groups with respect to operative time , fluoroscopy time , and incision length , with the difference favoring Group B for each parameter . Analog pain scale values were similar in Group A ( 2.49 ) and Group B ( 2.15 ) at twelve months postoperatively . CONCLUSIONS Patients in our prospective randomized study who were treated with trochanteric nailing did not differ in hip function at one year postoperatively compared with patients treated with **intramedullary** **nailing** through the piriformis fossa . The values of several intraoperative parameters were significantly better in the trochanteric nailing group . Our data indicate that the functional hip outcome of femoral intramedullary nailing performed through the greater trochanter is equal to that of **intramedullary** **nailing** performed through the piriformis fossa .
