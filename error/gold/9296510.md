Comparison of **hand-sewn** and **stapled** **esophagogastric** **anastomosis** after esophageal resection for cancer : a prospective randomized controlled trial . OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare the **hand-sewn** and **stapled** methods in **esophagogastric** **anastomosis** **.** SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA After esophageal resection for cancer , the relative merits of the hand-sewn and the stapled methods of esophagogastric anastomosis , especially regarding leakage and stricture rates , have not adequately been studied . METHODS A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 122 patients with squamous cell cancer of the thoracic esophagus who underwent a **Lewis-Tanner** **esophagectomy** **.** Patients were stratified according to esophageal size , based on the diameter of the divided esophagus ( < or > or = 30 mm ) and then were randomized to have either a **hand-sewn** **or** **a** **stapled** **anastomosis** **.** RESULTS The mean total operating times ( standard error of the mean ) when the hand-sewn and the stapled methods were used were 214 ( 4 ) minutes and 217 ( 3.4 ) minutes , respectively ( p = not significant [ NS ] ) . The respective in vivo proximal resection margins ( standard error of the mean ) were 8 ( 0.4 ) cm and 7.6 ( 0.4 ) cm ( p = NS ) . Leakage rates were 1.6 % and 4.9 % ( p = NS ) . Excluding hospital deaths , patients with leakage or anastomotic recurrence , and those who received radiation therapy to histologically infiltrated resection margin , anastomotic stricture was found in 5 ( 9.1 % ) of 55 patients in the hand-sewn group and 20 ( 40 % ) of 50 in the stapler group ( p = 0.0003 ) . The difference in stricture rates was significant in small as well as large esophagi . Anastomotic recurrence developed in only one patient in each group . CONCLUSIONS The authors conclude that both methods were safe , but the stapled technique resulted in more stricture formation .
