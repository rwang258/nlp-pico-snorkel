A phase I study of **recombinant** **human** **ciliary** **neurotrophic** **factor** **(** **rHCNTF** **)** in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . The ALS CNTF Treatment Study ( ACTS ) Phase I-II Study Group . Fifty-seven patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 10 , or 30 micrograms/kg **recombinant** **human** **ciliary** **neurotrophic** **factor** **(** **rHCNTF** **)** or **placebo** subcutaneously 3 times a week for 2 weeks . Dose-limiting toxicity , consisting of febrile reactions in some patients , fatigue , and nonproductive cough , was observed at a dose level of 30 micrograms/kg . Dose-related changes in parameters of the acute-phase response were noted , consistent with the relationship of **CNTF** and its receptor system to the cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and its receptor . No adverse neurologic consequences of **rHCNTF** administration were observed . Antibodies to **rHCNTF** were observed in sera of most patients tested after 2 weeks of continuous treatment and 4 weeks ' withdrawal period . **rHCNTF** was safe and tolerated within acceptable limits when administered to patients with ALS in this study at doses of up to 30 micrograms/kg 3 times a week for 2 weeks . Further studies to explore the efficacy of **rHCNTF** in the treatment of human motor neuron diseases are justified .
