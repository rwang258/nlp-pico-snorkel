Hepatic cytoprotective effect of **ischemic** **and** **anesthetic** **preconditioning** before liver resection when using intermittent vascular inflow occlusion : a randomized clinical trial . BACKGROUND **Ischemic** **preconditioning** **(** **IPC** **)** and **anesthetic** **preconditioning** **(** **APC** **)** have been reported to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury after liver resection under continuous inflow occlusion . This study evaluates whether these strategies enhance hepatic protection of remnant liver against IR after liver resection with **intermittent** **clamping** **(** **INT** **)** **.** METHODS A total of 106 patients without underlying liver disease and submitted to liver resection using INT were randomized into 3 groups : **IPC** **(** **10** **minutes** **of** **inflow** **occlusion** **followed** **by** **10** **minutes** **of** **reperfusion** **before** **liver** **transection** **)** **,** **APC** **(** **sevoflurane** **administration** **for** **20** **minutes** **before** **liver** **transection** **)** **,** **and** **INT** **(** **no** **preconditioning** **)** **.** Patients were also stratified according to the extent of the hepatectomy . Cytoprotection was evaluated by comparing hepatocyte and endothelial dysfunction markers , apoptosis , histologic lesions , and postoperative outcome . RESULTS No differences were observed in preoperative chemotherapy and steatosis , total warm ischemia time , operative time , or blood loss . Kinetics of transaminases ( aspartate aminotransferase , P = .137 ; alanine aminotransferase , P = .616 ) , bilirubin ( P = .980 ) , and hyaluronic acid increase ( P = .514 ) revealed no differences . Significant apoptosis was present in 40 % of patients , mild-to-moderate leukocyte infiltration and steatosis in 45 % and 55 % , respectively , and mild sinusoidal congestion in 65 % , with a similar distribution in the 3 groups . When patients were stratified by major versus minor resections , no differences were observed in any of the variables studied . Postoperative clinical outcomes were also similar . CONCLUSION These results suggest that these **protocols** **of** **IPC** **and** **APC** used in this study do not provide better cytoprotection from IR when **INT** is used .
