[ Effect of **ulinastatin** on inflammatory responses induced by oesophagectomy ] . OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of **ulinastatin** ( UTI ) on the inflammatory responses induced by oesophagectomy . METHODS Forty patients with esophageal cancer ( without serious hypertension , heart disease , or respiratory function impairment , including 34 men and 6 women aged 46 to 70 years ) scheduled for **oesophagectomy** **via** **left** **thoracotomy** were randomly divided into control group ( n=20 ) and UTI group ( n=20 ) . **Anesthesia** **induction** and perioperative management followed the same protocols in the two groups , and in UTI group , patients **received** **5000** **U/kg** **UTI** while those in the control group were given the same volume of saline . Before operation ( T ( 1 ) ) , 10 min after recovery of two-lung ventilation ( T ( 2 ) ) , and 24 h ( T ( 3 ) ) and 48 h ( T ( 4 ) ) after operation , the venous blood sample was taken from the internal jugular vein and the plasma was separated and stored at -70 degrees C for later analysis of IL-6 and IL-8 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . The bronchoalveoar lavage fluid ( BAFL ) was also collected at T ( 1 ) and T ( 2 ) for IL-6 and IL-8 detection . RESULTS IL-6 , IL-8 levels in the plasma and BALF collected at T ( 2 ) -T ( 4 ) increased significantly as compared with those in samples collected at T ( 1 ) , and their peak concentration inplasma and BALF samples were similar . IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the UTI group were significantly lower than those in the control group during the time points of T ( 2 ) -T ( 4 ) . CONCLUSION Inflammatory responses occur during and after oesophagectomy , which can be inhibited with UTI .
