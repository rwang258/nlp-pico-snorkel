Absence of central effects in man of the **benzodiazepine** antagonist **Ro** **15-1788** **.** The benzodiazepines are typified by a profile of side effects which includes drowsiness , ataxia and incoordination . **Ro** **15-1788** , an imidazodiazepine derivative , exhibits marked antagonism of the behavioural and biochemical effects of the benzodiazepines in animals and man . It is devoid of any behavioural activity in animals , except at very high doses . In the present study the effects of single rising oral doses of **Ro** **15-1788** on cognitive , psychomotor and subjective function in man have been assessed using a battery of psychometric tests designed to identify the sedative action of the benzodiazepines . At all doses up to 600 mg , Ro 15-1788 demonstrated none of the classical behavioural effects of the benzodiazepines .
