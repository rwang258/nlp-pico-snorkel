# nlp-pico-snorkel
 
Current progress:
- (done) reading Bojian's paper. 
- (done) looking at his code.
- (done) looking for a BERT tutorial
- (done) finished BERT implementation

2/11 Action Items:
- Logging into the GPU. (done)
- Running the supervised model with PICO on the GPU. (not done)
    - Currently calling IT support (resolved)
    - Currently installing some things like jupyter in my directory (is this ok?)
    - Creating a virtual env currently
        - export PATH=/share/apps/anaconda3/2021.05/bin:$PATH
    - asking IT for help with GPU access still


**new_snorkel_pico.ipynb** is applying Snorkel to the EBM-NLP PICO dataset.

**supervised_learning.ipynb** is the baseline BERT supervised learning model on the same intervention labeling task with the same dataset.
